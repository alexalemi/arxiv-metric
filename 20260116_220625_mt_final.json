Before looking for places to share, I'd suggest a different approach that might be more rewarding:\n\n**First, learn what Einstein actually said.** Most alternative theories inadvertently reinvent something already known or contradict well-tested observations. Understanding General Relativity - even conceptually - helps you see what any new theory needs to explain.\n\n**Some good starting points:**\n- Popular books by physicists (Brian Greene, Carlo Rovelli, Kip Thorne)\n- Online courses (MIT OpenCourseWare, Khan Academy)\n- Physics forums where you can *ask questions* rather than post theories\n\n**Why this matters:**\nEinstein's theory makes incredibly precise predictions that have been confirmed thousands of times - GPS satellites, gravitational waves, black hole images, Mercury's orbit, etc. Any alternative needs to explain all of these equally well *plus* solve a problem GR can't.\n\n**If you still want to share:**\n- r/HypotheticalPhysics on Reddit (specifically for non-professional theories, but expect critical feedback)\n- Physics Stack Exchange (for questions, not theories)\n\n**Fair warning:** Most physics communities discourage unsolicited theories from non-specialists, not from elitism, but because they receive many similar posts and don't have time to provide the physics education needed to explain why they don't work.\n\nThe genuine path forward is learning the existing physics first. Your intuitions might lead somewhere interesting once informed by what we already know!",

Apply for Independent Researcher Status**\nContact arXiv directly explaining your situation. They do accommodate independent researchers, though they evaluate on a case-by-case basis.\n\n**3. Alternative Preprint Servers**\nConsider:\n- **OSF Preprints** (Open Science Framework)\n- **ResearchGate**\n- **Zenodo**\n- Field-specific repositories\n\nThese often have fewer barriers to entry and still provide DOIs and timestamps for your work.\n\n**4.

I have \ncompleted a paper titled \"[Title]\" that I would like to submit to \narXiv in the [category] category.\n\nAs an independent researcher without institutional affiliation, I \nneed an endorsement to submit. I'm reaching out because [your work \non X relates to my research / we met at Y conference / etc.].\n\nI've attached my paper abstract below for your review. The \nendorsement process is simple on arXiv's end - you would just need \nto confirm that I appear to be a genuine researcher in this field.\n\nI understand you're busy, so I appreciate any consideration. Please \nlet me know if you need any additional information.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your name]\n[Link to any existing publications, website, or Google Scholar]\n\n---\n[Abstract]\n```\n\n## Key Tips:\n\n**Do:**\n- Be professional and concise\n- Explain why you chose them specifically\n- Include your abstract (not the full paper initially)\n- Provide evidence of your work (website, previous publications, GitHub if relevant)\n- Make it clear you understand endorsement \u2260 peer review\n- Follow up politely once after 1-2 weeks if no response\n\n**Don't:**\n- Send mass emails\n- Ask them to review your paper in detail\n- Be pushy or entitled\n- Send without proofreading\n\n## Building Credibility\n\nTo increase your chances:\n- Have a professional web presence (personal website, ORCID, Google Scholar)\n- Engage genuinely in your research community (conferences, seminars, online forums)\n- Consider publishing in a peer-reviewed journal first if possible\n- Present at conferences or workshops\n\n## If You Get Rejections\n\n- Don't take it personally - people are busy\n- Try 5-10 people before getting discouraged\n- Each endorser can only endorse a limited number of people, so some may be at their limit\n\n## Alternative Strategy\n\nPost your paper on one of the alternative preprint servers I mentioned first. This:\n- Establishes your work publicly\n- Gives you a citable reference\n- May make endorsers more comfortable\n\nWould you like help with any specific part of this process?",

You submit your paper\n2. arXiv asks you to request endorsement\n3. You contact potential endorsers (you find them yourself)\n4. If someone endorses you, your paper gets posted\n5. After 4+ endorsed papers, you can endorse others\n\n# The Reality Check\n\n**This system is genuinely difficult without academic connections.** Endorsers are putting their reputation on the line, so they typically only endorse:\n- Students/colleagues they know personally\n- Researchers whose work they're familiar with\n- Papers that meet professional standards\n\nCold-emailing professors rarely works, especially without institutional affiliation or prior publications.\n\n# Before Seeking Endorsement\n\nI'd strongly encourage you to:\n\n**1. Get expert feedback first** - Before pursuing arXiv, have physicists review your ideas informally. This helps you understand if you're on the right track.\n\n**2. Understand the bar** - arXiv papers are expected to be research-grade work with proper mathematics, citations, and engagement with existing literature.\n\n**3. Consider if arXiv is the right goal** - If you're developing ideas outside mainstream physics, there may be better ways to share them.\n\nWhat specifically have you been working on? That context would help me suggest more targeted next steps.",

Many negative results never get published\n\n3. **Domain expertise matters** - Doctors/researchers haven't \"missed\" something just because it's not mainstream. They may have good reasons (failed replications, known confounders, mechanistic implausibility)\n\n**Better approaches:**\n\n- Share your observation with actual researchers in the field - email professors who work on related topics\n- Post in appropriate scientific forums for feedback first\n- Consider if you're experiencing the Dunning-Kruger effect (we all do in unfamiliar domains)\n- If you genuinely think you have something, collaborate with someone with medical/research credentials\n\n**Most importantly:** Please don't encourage people to act on unvetted medical theories.

Does it reduce to known physics in appropriate limits?\n\n**Red flags to examine honestly:**\n- If your theory contradicts well-tested physics without explaining why experiments seemed to confirm the old theory\n- If you haven't worked through the math of existing theories first\n- If no one with expertise finds it compelling\n\nWhat specific problem in physics are you addressing?

Here are some good options for sharing your work:\n\n## Quick & High Visibility\n- **Chess Programming Wiki** - Post on forums like [talkchess.com](http://talkchess.com) where chess engine developers actively discuss new approaches\n- **r/ComputerChess subreddit** - Good for initial feedback and visibility\n- **Your own blog/GitHub** - Write a detailed post and share it on Hacker News, which researchers often read\n\n## More Formal Options\n- **arXiv.org** - Free preprint server where you can publish without peer review. Use the cs.AI category. No academic affiliation needed, and researchers check it daily\n- **ICGA Journal** - The International Computer Games Association publishes chess engine research\n- **IEEE Conference on Games (CoG)** - Accepts industry submissions, not just academic ones\n\n## What to Include\n- Your approach and what makes it different\n- Head-to-head results vs Stockfish (time controls, hardware, number of games, win/draw/loss record)\n- Example games showing interesting play\n- Code/implementation details if you're willing to share\n\n## Reality Check\nMake sure you're testing fairly - same hardware, time controls, and enough games for statistical significance. Stockfish sometimes loses, so you'll want to show consistent performance.\n\nStart with talkchess.com or arXiv - both will get you feedback and visibility among people who care about this stuff."

Abstract (200-300 words)**\n- What your approach is in 1-2 sentences\n- Key result (e.g., \"achieves X% win rate against Stockfish\")\n- Why it's interesting/different\n\n**2. Introduction**\n- Brief background on chess AI\n- What existing approaches do (minimax/alpha-beta, neural nets like AlphaZero)\n- What problem you're solving or what you're doing differently\n- Your main contribution\n\n**3. Method/Approach**\n- **This is the core** - explain your algorithm clearly\n- Use diagrams if helpful\n- What inspired this approach?\n- Key differences from standard engines\n- Any novel data structures, evaluation methods, or search strategies\n\n**4. Experimental Setup**\n- Hardware specs (CPU/GPU, RAM)\n- Stockfish version and settings\n- Time controls (e.g., 1 min per move, or 40 moves in 15 min)\n- Opening book used (if any)\n- Number of games played\n\n**5. Results**\n- Win/draw/loss statistics\n- Elo rating estimate if possible\n- Show 2-3 interesting example games with annotations\n- Where does your engine excel? Where does it struggle?\n\n**6. Discussion**\n- Why you think your approach works\n- Limitations\n- Comparison to other methods\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n- Summary of findings\n- Future work\n\n**8. References**\n- Cite Stockfish, AlphaZero paper, any algorithms you built on\n\n## Important Tips\n\n**Be honest about limitations** - researchers respect this more than hype\n\n**Statistical significance** - You need enough games. 100+ is minimum, 1000+ is better. Report confidence intervals if possible.\n\n**Reproducibility** - Give enough detail that someone could recreate your tests. Consider sharing code.\n\n**Define \"beats sometimes\"** - Is it 5% win rate? 40%? Context matters a lot.\n\n**Comparison baseline** - Also test against other engines at different strengths if possible (Leela Chess Zero, older Stockfish versions)\n\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- Testing against Stockfish with different time controls\n- Cherry-picking your best games\n- Not accounting for opening book advantages\n- Unclear whether you mean win rate or just \"won some games\"\n\n## Format\n- PDF format\n- Clear figures and tables\n- ~4-8 pages is typical for this kind of work\n- Use a clean template (LaTeX is standard but not required)\n\nWould you like help with any specific section? What's the core idea behind your approach?"

Workshop papers**\n- NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR have workshops with lower barriers\n- Some specifically welcome practitioner work\n- Light peer review, real venue on your CV\n\n**3. Distill.pub**\n- If your work has strong visual/interactive explanations\n- High bar for quality, but no academic credentials needed\n\n## Share Your Code & Results\n\n**While pursuing formal publication:**\n- **GitHub repo** with clear README, reproducible code\n- **Blog post** explaining your approach (Medium, personal site)\n- **Hugging Face** if it's an NLP model\n- **Papers with Code** to link your results to benchmarks\n\n## Full Conference Papers\n\nTop venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) accept independent researchers, but:\n- Very competitive\n- Expect rigorous experiments, baselines, ablations\n- Benefits from collaborating with someone experienced\n\n**Realistic tip:** Many successful independent researchers start with arXiv + strong GitHub presence, which sometimes leads to collaborations or workshop invitations.\n\nWhat type of project is it?

By how much?\n- This proves your design choices aren't arbitrary\n\n### 4. **Document Everything**\n\nKeep a research log:\n- Exact hyperparameters\n- Hardware specs\n- Training time\n- Any weird bugs or observations\n- Code version control (use Git)\n\n### 5. **Sanity Checks**\n\n- Can you overfit a small dataset? (If not, implementation bug)\n- Do learning curves look reasonable?\n- Does it work on multiple datasets?\n\n### 6. **Share Preliminary Results**\n\nPost on:\n- r/MachineLearning (weekly discussion thread)\n- Twitter/X with #MachineLearning\n- Get feedback before writing full paper\n\n**Time estimate:** If results hold up, you'll have a real paper in 1-2 months.

Your theory will be immediately compared against:\n\n- **MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics)** - explains rotation curves well but fails for galaxy clusters\n- **Cold Dark Matter** - explains rotation curves plus much more\n- Dozens of other proposed modifications\n\n**For sentence 2, you'll need to state what makes your approach different:**\n- Is it modified gravity?\n- A new force law?\n- New particle physics?\n- Modified inertia?\n\n**And critically - have you:**\n- Calculated an actual rotation curve for a specific galaxy (like M33 or NGC 3198)?\n- Compared your numbers to the observational data?\n- Checked whether your theory also explains the Tully-Fisher relation?\n\nI'm asking because if you write sentence 2 claiming your approach works, reviewers will immediately ask \"what are the numbers?\" \n\nWhat type of modification does your theory propose?",
