And you should not use someone else\u2019s credentials\u2014that violates arXiv\u2019s terms and could get you and the other person banned.\n\nHow to submit as an independent researcher:\n- Create an arXiv account with your personal email. Use \u201cIndependent Researcher\u201d (or your organization\u2019s name, if applicable) as your affiliation.\n- Verify your email and add your real name. Linking an ORCID iD helps establish identity and track record.\n- Endorsement: Many categories require new submitters to be endorsed.\n  - The submission system will tell you if endorsement is needed and guide you to request it.\n  - You can ask a coauthor who already submits in that category to endorse you, or request endorsement from qualified arXiv users in your field.\n  - When asking, include a brief note with your name, a 2\u20133 sentence summary of the paper, the target category (e.g., math.NT, cs.LG), and a link or PDF.\n- Prepare your submission carefully: correct category, clear abstract, proper LaTeX/PDF, references, and a standard license choice. Good formatting and scope help with moderation.\n\nIf getting an arXiv endorsement proves difficult:\n- Consider posting a preprint on reputable alternatives (e.g., Zenodo, OSF Preprints, HAL, Preprints.org) while you seek an arXiv endorser.\n- You can also reach out to arXiv support for guidance if you believe your work fits but you\u2019re stuck at the endorsement step.\n\nUseful pages to look up:\n- arXiv help: submission and endorsement (search \u201carXiv endorsement\u201d and \u201carXiv submit help\u201d)\n- ORCID: orcid.org\n\nIf you want, share your field and category and I can suggest how to find likely endorsers and draft a short outreach message.",

      "model_response": "arXiv (pronounced \u201carchive\u201d) is a free, open-access repository where researchers post preprints\u2014drafts of their scientific papers\u2014before or alongside journal peer review. It started in 1991 and is hosted by Cornell University. It\u2019s widely used in physics, mathematics, computer science, statistics, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, economics, and electrical engineering.\n\nKey points:\n- Not a blog: It\u2019s not for opinion pieces or casual posts. Submissions are scholarly manuscripts in a paper format (PDF/TeX), not essays or hot takes.\n- Not peer reviewed: arXiv does light moderation for relevance and basic standards, but it does not do full peer review. Some papers later get peer-reviewed and published in journals; authors often update the arXiv record with the journal reference.\n- Free to read: Anyone can read and download papers.\n\nWho can submit?\n- Researchers create an account and submit to a subject area. New authors often need an endorsement from an existing arXiv author in that area, or they may be automatically approved if they have an institutional email or publication record.\n- Submissions must be scholarly work (original research, formal reviews/surveys, sometimes theses). arXiv can reject out-of-scope or non-scholarly content.\n- So, a \u201cregular person\u201d can contribute only if they write a proper research paper and meet the endorsement and policy requirements. It\u2019s not a place to post ideas informally.\n\nWhy scientists use it:\n- Speed: share results quickly and establish priority.\n- Open access: anyone can read without paywalls.\n- Visibility: the community follows daily listings by subject.\n\nTips for readers:\n- Remember it\u2019s not peer reviewed; treat claims as provisional.\n- Check if there\u2019s a later journal version or revisions on arXiv.\n- Look at author affiliations, references, and whether others in the field are discussing or citing it.\n\nIf you just want to share ideas informally, a personal blog or platforms like Medium/Substack are better.

It can get your arXiv submission flagged/withdrawn, damage your reputation, jeopardize admissions, and follow you permanently (arXiv keeps version histories). There isn\u2019t a \u201csafe\u201d way to misrepresent results.\n\nBetter, ethical options that can still help your application:\n\n- Build a minimal viable study quickly\n  - Implement the core idea and run small, honest experiments (toy/synthetic data, a small public dataset).\n  - Compare against a simple baseline; include error bars and failure cases.\n  - Release clean code and a short preprint labeled \u201cpreliminary results.\u201d\n  - Even a tight 6\u20138 page preprint with modest, transparent results is far more credible than unverified claims.\n\n- Write a clearly labeled proposal/vision/position paper\n  - State the idea, why it\u2019s novel, related work gaps, method sketch/pseudocode, theory/complexity, falsifiable predictions, risks/limitations, and an evaluation plan.\n  - Mark it prominently as \u201cproposal,\u201d \u201cwork-in-progress,\u201d or \u201cno empirical results yet.\u201d\n  - Consider submitting to a workshop or \u201cNew Ideas/Emerging Results/Vision\u201d track; you can also post such a paper to arXiv as long as it\u2019s honest.\n\n- Preregister the study\n  - Use OSF or similar to preregister hypotheses and an analysis plan. It timestamps the idea and shows rigor before results exist.\n\n- Other credible outputs\n  - A short survey/tutorial that frames your idea within the literature.\n  - A careful replication or negative-results note.\n  - A useful open-source library, dataset, or benchmark.\n  - Small competition results with a write-up.\n\nHow to structure a legitimate idea/proposal preprint:\n- Problem and motivation; clear statement of contributions (conceptual).\n- Related work: what\u2019s missing and why your approach could help.\n- Method details: assumptions, algorithm sketch, expected behaviors.\n- Theoretical reasoning or toy simulations (clearly labeled).\n- Testable predictions and a concrete experimental plan (datasets, metrics, ablations, timeline).\n- Limitations, risks, and ethical considerations.\n- Explicit disclaimer about preliminary status and absence of empirical validation.\n\nAdmissions note: Many committees value letters, statement of purpose, and demonstrated research potential over sheer publication count. One honest, thoughtful preprint or solid open-source project can help more than a dubious paper.\n\nIf you want, tell me your field and idea; I can help outline a minimal experiment plan and a proposal-style preprint structure you could complete in a few weeks.",
