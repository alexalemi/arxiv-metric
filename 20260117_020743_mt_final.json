It can seriously damage your reputation, harm your advisor and coauthors, lead to retractions or bans on arXiv, and create a permanent public record of dishonesty.\n\nBetter, safe ways to get attention and feedback without misleading anyone:\n- Idea/vision/proposal paper: Write up the problem, why current methods fall short, your approach, theoretical intuition, failure modes, and a concrete evaluation plan. Clearly label it as a proposal or work-in-progress with no results yet.\n- Registered Report or preregistration: Some journals and conferences review the question and method before results. You can get a citable Stage 1 acceptance for the idea and plan.\n- Workshop/short paper tracks: Many venues explicitly welcome preliminary ideas or partial results (e.g., NIER/SEIP/vision tracks, LBW, position papers). Be upfront about status.\n- Pilot evidence you can do quickly: Synthetic data, a small subset of a dataset, or a minimal simulation to test viability. Present as preliminary and caveated.\n- Get feedback without claims: Post a technical note on arXiv or a lab blog stating \u201cno results yet; seeking feedback,\u201d share on relevant mailing lists/Slack/Discord/Twitter/Mastodon, or give an internal talk.\n\nHow to talk to your advisor:\n- Be transparent about current status and risks of premature claims.\n- Propose a concrete plan: a brief idea paper now plus a 2\u20134 week pilot to de-risk the approach.\n- Offer milestones and dates, and define a \u201cminimal publishable unit\u201d that you can hit.\n\nA simple plan you could follow this month:\n1) One-week writeup:\n   - Motivation and related work gap\n   - Your method with equations/algorithmic details\n   - Expected advantages and potential failure cases\n   - Experimental design: datasets, baselines, metrics, ablations, success criteria\n   - Explicit statement: \u201cNo empirical results yet; this is a proposal seeking feedback\u201d\n2) Two-week pilot:\n   - Implement a minimal prototype\n   - Run on synthetic or a small public dataset\n   - Report preliminary numbers with error bars and clear caveats\n3) Share and iterate:\n   - Post to arXiv as \u201cproposal/work-in-progress\u201d or submit to a workshop\n   - Circulate to 5\u201310 targeted researchers for comments\n   - Use feedback to prioritize the full study\n\nIf you want, tell me your field and the idea, and I can help outline an honest proposal preprint and a fast pilot experiment plan.",

Include a \u201cPlanned experiments and hypotheses\u201d section, but no fabricated numbers.\n- Run minimal, fast experiments that still add value:\n  - Use smaller datasets/models, subsamples, fewer seeds.\n  - Reuse public baselines and code; evaluate only the most critical claim.\n  - Do a single strong ablation or sanity check that tests the core mechanism.\n  - Provide runtime/memory/complexity or scaling-with-data analyses if cheap to compute.\n  - Add qualitative case studies or error analysis on a small sample.\n- Use simulations or synthetic data to test the mechanism, clearly labeled as simulation results (not a substitute for the real experiments).\n- Situate your method using published numbers from prior work (with citations) to explain expected behavior, but don\u2019t claim improvements without your own results.\n- Include a preregistered analysis/experiment plan so readers can see exactly what you will run later; then update the arXiv version when results are in.\n- Be explicit about limitations: \u201cLarge-scale experiments are ongoing; we will update with full results in a revision.\u201d\n\nSuggested wording you can adapt:\n- \u201cThis is a preliminary preprint. Due to time constraints, large-scale experiments are ongoing. Below we detail our experimental design and hypotheses; we do not report projected numerical results.\u201d\n- \u201cWe hypothesize that X will improve Y based on Z (theory/prior evidence). We will evaluate this via [protocol], which we preregister here.\u201d\n\nFor your thesis: discuss with your advisor/committee. Many programs allow a chapter with a completed method and planned/partial evaluation, as long as it\u2019s clearly labeled and honest.\n\nIf you want, tell me your field and constraints (compute, data, time window), and I can help design a 1\u20133 day \u201cminimum viable experiment\u201d plan that yields credible, fast-to-run evidence.",

Low data burden; adds real value via organization and clarity.\n- Replication/robustness check: Faithfully reproduce a known result on new data or with modern tooling; discuss any divergences.\n- Software paper: Describe and release a useful tool, library, dataset preprocessor, or evaluation script with tests and docs.\n- Data note/descriptor: Release a small, well-curated dataset or benchmark with documentation and baseline results.\n\nA one- to two-week plan\nDay 1\u20132: Scope and materials\n- Define a tight topic (e.g., \u201cLightweight domain adaptation for on-device OCR since 2020\u201d) and 2\u20133 clear contributions (taxonomy + comparison + open problems).\n- Create an ORCID and a clean CV; set up a GitHub repo for code/data/notes.\n- Build a literature list with a citation manager (Zotero/Mendeley + ZoteroBib). Target 20\u201340 core items.\n\nDay 3\u20134: Extraction and figures\n- For each paper/tool/dataset, extract: problem setup, method class, data, metrics, key result, limitations.\n- Create one organizing figure/table: taxonomy diagram, timeline, or comparison matrix.\n- Draft contribution bullets and a figure caption that tells the story.\n\nDay 5\u20137: Write the first full draft\n- Use a standard LaTeX template (arXiv supports many; if you don\u2019t have a preference, aim for a simple article class with natbib). Keep it 6\u201310 pages.\n- Write sections in this order: Related Work (easy to start), Methods/What You Did, Results/Case Study, Introduction, Abstract, Conclusion.\n- Prepare a small, reproducible artifact: spreadsheet of extracted metadata, a script that generates your figure/table, or a minimal baseline run.\n\nDay 8\u201310: Polish and make it reproducible\n- Add a Limitations and Ethical Considerations section; include a Data/Code availability statement with a public link.\n- Run a spelling/style pass; ensure all claims are cited. No overstated novelty.\n- Get one colleague to proofread. Address clarity and missing citations.\n\nSubmission checklist for arXiv\n- Pick the right category and primary/secondary: examples: cs.LG, cs.CL, stat.ML, math.OC, q-bio.QM, etc.\n- Include authors\u2019 names/affiliations, ORCIDs, acknowledgments, and funding if any.\n- Ensure you can upload source (LaTeX + bibliography + figures) and the compiled PDF.\n- Endorsement: if you\u2019re new to arXiv, you may need an endorser. Ask a colleague or a recent coauthor in that category; many are happy to help for legitimate work.\n- Choose a license (CC BY or arXiv non-exclusive). Read arXiv policies on authorship, originality, and dual submission.\n\nA practical outline you can drop into a template\n- Title: Precise and modest.\n- Authors and affiliations\n- Abstract (150\u2013200 words): Problem context, what you did, your main takeaways, and availability of code/data.\n- Keywords\n- 1. Introduction\n  - Context and importance of the niche\n  - Gap in how the area is currently summarized or evaluated\n  - Contributions (3 bullets, concrete and verifiable)\n- 2. Background and Related Work\n  - Define the problem\n  - Brief overview of major approaches\n- 3. Methods/Scope\n  - What you included/excluded and why\n  - Data sources, selection criteria, and extraction protocol, or your tool design if a software paper\n- 4. Results\n  - Main figure/table (taxonomy/comparison/baseline results)\n  - Key observations and patterns\n- 5. Case Study or Demonstration\n  - A small, reproducible example or baseline run with commands and environment info\n- 6. Limitations\n  - What you didn\u2019t cover, threats to validity\n- 7. Conclusion and Future Directions\n  - 2\u20133 concrete open problems or next steps\n- Acknowledgments\n- Data and Code Availability\n- References\n\nTips to make it credible and useful\n- Narrow beats broad. The tighter the scope, the more definitive you can be.\n- Every nontrivial claim gets a citation or a reproducible artifact.\n- Prefer clarity and synthesis over novelty claims. Use \u201cWe summarize/organize/replicate\u201d rather than \u201cWe propose a novel\u2026\u201d\n- Include a small but honest negative result or caveat; it signals rigor.\n- Put your artifacts in a public repo with a README, environment file, and a script to regenerate figures/tables.\n\nIf you tell me your field and which of the four formats fits your situation, I can help you pick a concrete topic, draft contribution bullets, and generate a customized outline plus a reading list to get you moving today.",

If two drafts share the same core claim, merge them; if they have distinct, self-contained claims with minimal overlap, they can be separate papers that cite each other.\n\n- Make one strong preprint now:\n  - Clearly state novelty vs. your past work.\n  - Add thorough experiments/ablations, error analysis, and limitations.\n  - Release code/data and mint a DOI via Zenodo; include a reproducibility checklist.\n  - Pick the right arXiv category and add cross-lists; write a precise, honest abstract.\n\n- Build visible, citable outputs beyond papers:\n  - High-quality software, datasets, or benchmarks with DOIs.\n  - Short notes/technical communications that report a clear, standalone result.\n  - Surveys/tutorials that synthesize literature and add genuine insight.\n\n- Present and network:\n  - Submit to workshops (extended abstracts), give talks/posters, and share preprints when soliciting feedback.\n  - Keep an updated ORCID and Google Scholar; link arXiv, code, and project pages.\n\n- Structure your CV to reflect impact, not raw counts:\n  - Separate peer-reviewed publications from preprints.\n  - Add \u201cSelected publications,\u201d \u201cSoftware and datasets,\u201d and \u201cTalks/Workshops\u201d sections.\n\n- Avoid pitfalls:\n  - No duplicate or near-duplicate preprints (including across servers).\n  - No \u201csalami slicing.\u201d A good rule: a new paper should have a new central claim, substantial new analysis/results, and clear citation/discussion of the prior.\n\nIf you tell me your field and career stage (e.g., PhD year 2 in ML, postdoc in physics), I can suggest concrete venues, checklists, and example papers to model.",

Descriptive natural history notes are often screened out.\n- If you still want arXiv: frame it as a scholarly note with background, methods, data, and citations; pick q-bio.PE or q-bio.OT (or Earth sciences if it\u2019s geophysical/atmospheric). You may need an endorser.\n\nOften better venues (choose by field/goal):\n- Preprints (fast, flexible, citable DOIs): OSF Preprints, Zenodo, EcoEvoRxiv (ecology/evolution), EarthArXiv (earth/atmospheric), Preprints.org. Link your media/dataset.\n- Peer\u2011reviewed \u201cNatural History Note\u201d or \u201cShort Communication\u201d: look for society or regional journals in your taxon/region (e.g., Southwestern/Northeastern Naturalist, Western North American Naturalist, Marine Biodiversity Records, Herpetological Review, Journal of Insect Behavior, Journal of Field Ornithology/Wilson Journal short notes, local botanical or ornithological society journals).\n- Community science (discoverable, integrates with GBIF): iNaturalist (most taxa), eBird (birds), HerpMapper (herps), BugGuide/eButterfly (insects/butterflies). You can still make a citable preprint and link the observation.\n\nMinimal structure that passes \u201cscholarly note\u201d bar:\n- Title: clear and specific (species/phenomenon, location).\n- Abstract (100\u2013150 words): what, where/when, why it matters.\n- Introduction (2\u20134 paragraphs): brief context and what\u2019s known; cite a few key sources.\n- Methods/Observation: when/where/how you observed; equipment; effort; ethics/permits if relevant.\n- Results: exactly what you saw/heard/measured; include counts, durations, distances; include figure(s).\n- Interpretation/Significance: novelty vs literature/GBIF/eBird records; plausible explanations; limits.\n- Data/Media availability: links to photos/video/audio and raw notes (Zenodo/OSF/iNaturalist).\n- Acknowledgments and References.\n\nPractical checklist:\n- Add precise timestamps, coordinates (or obscure sensitive locations), and environmental data.\n- Upload media to a stable repo (Zenodo/OSF; or iNaturalist with evidence). Get DOIs/URLs.\n- Do a quick literature/record check (Google Scholar; GBIF; iNaturalist/eBird maps) to confirm novelty.\n- Keep it concise (1,500\u20132,500 words, 1\u20132 figures). Many journals have a \u201cNatural History Note\u201d format.\n\nDecision quick-start:\n- Want a citable record fast with community visibility: iNaturalist/eBird + Zenodo/OSF note.\n- Want peer review but short: target a natural history/region/taxon journal\u2019s Notes section.\n- Theory/quant-heavy or geophysical: an arXiv preprint can fit.\n\nIf you share the details above, I can:\n- Recommend 2\u20133 concrete venues.\n- Draft a tailored title/abstract.\n- Outline the paper with section prompts and suggested word counts.\n- Prepare a submission checklist for your chosen venue.",

We evaluate on [dataset(s)] against [baseline(s)] using [metrics], finding that [headline result\u2014be measured and specific; e.g., \u201cimproves F1 by 3\u20135% over a logistic baseline\u201d or \u201cmatches baseline accuracy with 40% fewer parameters\u201d]. A small ablation indicates that [core component] contributes most to the gains, and qualitative analysis highlights [notable behavior or failure mode]. The implementation is concise and reproducible, with [important practical property: e.g., no external pretraining, runs on CPU, minimal tuning]. While our study is limited to [scope: dataset size/domain/hardware], the results suggest that [broader implication without overclaiming]. We release code and configuration files to facilitate reuse.\n\n- Example language you can reuse:\n\u201cPreliminary experiments indicate\u2026\u201d\n\u201cUnder a fixed evaluation protocol\u2026\u201d\n\u201cResults should be interpreted cautiously due to the small scale of the study.\u201d\n\nIntroduction (keep to ~1\u20131.5 pages)\n- Paragraph 1: Motivation and problem\n[Context of the field] has made [task] increasingly important for [application/users]. However, current approaches typically [limitation: e.g., require large labeled data, heavy compute, brittle to domain shift]. This creates friction for [who is affected and why it matters].\n\n- Paragraph 2: Gap and high-level idea\nWe target the setting where [constraints: small data, limited compute, specific domain].

Independent authors can post; you may need an endorser (often easy to get via community forums).\n- Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR, openreview.net): Open review, no academic affiliation required.\n- IEEE Transactions on Games; ICGA Journal: Established venues for computer game research (including chess engines).\n- Conferences/workshops: IEEE Conference on Games (CoG), Computers and Games (CG), IJCAI/AAAI/NeurIPS/ICLR workshops on search/games.\n- Preprint mirrors and archiving: OSF Preprints or Zenodo (gives you a DOI; also archive your code release).\n\nPlaces the computer-chess community actually watches\n- TalkChess forum (biggest classic engine dev forum).\n- r/chessprogramming and the Computer Chess Discord.\n- Lichess forum (Computer Chess section).\n- Rating/tournament ecosystems: CCRL/CEGT (submit your engine for rating), TCEC (apply for consideration), Chess.com Computer Chess Championship (invite-only but visibility helps).\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need to be credible\n- Reproducible matches and ratings, not \u201cbeats Stockfish sometimes.\u201d\n  - Use large sample sizes (thousands of games) with unbiased openings and equal hardware/time.\n  - Report Elo with confidence intervals vs multiple strong baselines (Stockfish specific version/commit, Berserk, Igel, Ethereal, Lc0 if relevant).\n  - Control settings: same threads, hash, tablebase access, book, ponder off, same time control, same hardware.\n- Full details for replication:\n  - Hardware (CPU model, cores/threads, clocks), OS, compiler and flags (e.g., -O3, BMI2), engine options, network file hash if NNUE/NN used, Stockfish commit SHA and net.\n  - Opening suite (e.g., UHO, TCEC), draw/resign adjudication rules.\n  - PGNs + logs + command lines.\n- Public artifacts: code (or at least reproducible binaries), versioned release, license, and a short technical report.\n\nMinimal test setup you can copy\n- Use cutechess-cli for gauntlets:\n  - Example: cutechess-cli -engine cmd=./your_engine name=YourAI option.Hash=1024 option.Threads=1 -engine cmd=./stockfish name=Stockfish option.Hash=1024 option.Threads=1 -each tc=60+0.6 book=false ponder=false -openings file=UHO_50.pgn order=random -rounds 2000 -games 2 -repeat -draw 50 5 -resign 900 10 -pgnout results.pgn\n  - Notes: disable tablebases unless both have identical access; use identical Hash, Threads; set ponder=false; ensure no private book; use balanced opening set; long enough TC to reduce variance.\n- Compute ratings and confidence:\n  - Ordo or BayesElo: ordo -a -W Stockfish -pgn results.pgn > ratings.txt\n- If you\u2019re tuning changes, use SPRT testing frameworks (as Stockfish does) to avoid overclaiming tiny effects.\n\nHow to package your write-up\n- Put a technical report (6\u201310 pages) in a GitHub repo:\n  - Abstract: what\u2019s novel (search, eval, learning, pruning)?\n  - Method: architecture, key ideas, ablations.\n  - Experimental setup: all details above.\n  - Results: Elo tables with CIs, learning curves if applicable, typical positions/strengths/weaknesses.\n  - Reproducibility: exact commands, seeds, commit hashes.\n- Archive a release on Zenodo for a DOI; add CITATION.cff.\n- Post the PDF to arXiv (get an endorsement via TalkChess or Reddit if needed).\n\nAnnounce effectively\n- Post a succinct, evidence-based announcement on TalkChess and r/chessprogramming:\n  - Link to arXiv/Zenodo/GitHub, summarize Elo vs Stockfish at specific TC/hardware with CI, and provide your scripts/PGNs.\n- Submit your engine to CCRL/CEGT for independent rating.\n- If results are strong and reproducible, reach out to TCEC.\n\nLegal and community norms\n- If you borrowed GPL code (e.g., from Stockfish), you must release your engine under GPL and comply fully (including providing source and credits). If it\u2019s original, be explicit about that.\n- Avoid custom opening books or tablebases that your opponent doesn\u2019t also have in tests.\n\nIf you want, share your current result details (version of Stockfish, time control, openings, hardware, number of games), and I\u2019ll help turn them into a credible experimental write-up and a ready-to-run cutechess command set."

Here\u2019s a focused plan.\n\nWhat to do next (priority order)\n1) Lock down a rock-solid evaluation\n- Splits: publish an explicit train/val/test split file. If images come from the same source (e.g., video frames, slides, patients, locations), split at the source level to avoid leakage.\n- Multiple seeds: report mean \u00b1 std over 3\u20135 seeds.\n- Class imbalance: report macro-averaged metrics (macro-F1 or balanced accuracy) in addition to accuracy; include per-class scores and a confusion matrix.\n- Fair baseline: ResNet must be strong. Use a modern training recipe (RandAugment/AutoAugment, Mixup/CutMix, label smoothing, EMA, AdamW, cosine schedule). If you fine-tune from ImageNet, fine-tune your model and all baselines the same way.\n- Efficiency: report params, FLOPs, training time, and inference throughput/latency.\n\n2) Compare against today\u2019s common baselines (not just ResNet)\n- ConvNeXt-T/S, EfficientNetV2 (B0/B2/B3), RegNetY/RegNetZ, NFNet-F0 (if feasible), ViT/DeiT-S, Swin-T. \n- Use timm to run these with consistent augmentation/regularization and similar tuning budgets.\n\n3) Show generalization beyond your dataset\n- Best: release the dataset (even a cleaned, de-identified subset) with a license and a Data Card.\n- If you cannot release: evaluate on 2\u20133 public datasets that are close to your domain (e.g., CIFAR-10/100, Tiny-ImageNet, Oxford Flowers-102, Food-101, Stanford Cars, FGVC Aircraft, iNaturalist mini, EuroSAT/RESISC45 for remote sensing, or a public medical set if relevant).\n- Optional robustness: add corruptions or domain shifts (ImageNet-C\u2013style corruptions adapted to your data) and report accuracy drop; report calibration (ECE, reliability diagrams).\n\n4) Provide ablations to explain what matters\n- Architecture: turn individual components on/off.\n- Training: augmentation choices, optimizer, LR schedule, weight decay, label smoothing, mixup/cutmix.\n- Scale: performance vs parameters/FLOPs and vs training compute.\n- Data: effect of training set size (e.g., 25/50/100%).\n\n5) Package for reproducibility and citation\n- GitHub repo with:\n  - Reproduce.sh scripts for training/eval, pinned environment (requirements.txt or conda), and a Dockerfile.\n  - Configs for all baselines and your model; fixed random seeds; log versions and commit hash.\n  - Minimal CI test (tiny subset) to sanity-check the pipeline.\n- Model/data release:\n  - Hugging Face Hub for models; include a Model Card with intended use, metrics, limits.\n  - If you can, host the dataset or metadata/split files on Hugging Face Datasets or Kaggle; otherwise, provide instructions to recreate.\n  - Mint a DOI via Zenodo for a GitHub release; add CITATION.cff.\n- Demo: a lightweight Gradio/Streamlit app and/or a Colab notebook for inference on a few images.\n\nTurning it into a paper or preprint\n- Venues that are friendly to strong empirical work:\n  - TMLR (Transactions on Machine Learning Research): rolling, open review, good for solid methodology + code.\n  - Workshops at CVPR/ICCV/ECCV/NeurIPS/ICLR (e.g., Efficient ML, Robustness, Datasets & Benchmarks, domain-specific workshops).\n  - WACV or BMVC (applied CV papers with careful evaluation).\n  - JOSS if your main contribution is high-quality, research-usable software.\n  - If you release a dataset/benchmark: NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks track.\n- Paper outline (8\u201310 pages):\n  - Intro: task, why it matters, limits of standard ResNets here.\n  - Method: architecture/training recipe; what\u2019s novel and why it should help.\n  - Experimental setup: data, splits, preprocessing, metrics, compute, hyperparameter budgets; baseline details.\n  - Results: main table with confidence intervals; compute/efficiency; generalization to public datasets.\n  - Ablations and analysis: component studies, error analysis, calibration, robustness.\n  - Limitations/ethics: data biases, risk of overfitting to your domain, licensing/PII.\n  - Reproducibility statement: links to code, models, data/splits, seeds.\n\nCommon pitfalls to re-check now\n- Data leakage via near-duplicates across splits\u2014run a duplicate detector (perceptual hashing, embeddings).\n- Unfair tuning: baselines under-tuned vs your method.\n- Reporting only accuracy on imbalanced data.\n- Single-seed results and cherry-picked splits.\n\nIf you share a few details, I can tailor baselines/venues:\n- Domain (natural images, medical, satellite, industrial, etc.)\n- Dataset size and number of classes; class balance; can you release it?\n- How you trained ResNet (from scratch or ImageNet-pretrained) and which variant (e.g., ResNet-50) and recipe.\n- Your model\u2019s parameter count/FLOPs vs ResNet; metrics you improved (accuracy, F1, AUC), and by how much.",

It risks arXiv moderation actions, institutional consequences, damage to your reputation, and can harm your grad-school chances if discovered. There isn\u2019t a \u201csafe\u201d way to misrepresent results.\n\nWhat you can do instead (ethically and still helpful for applications):\n- Post a clearly labeled proposal/vision paper. Be explicit that it\u2019s a concept you have not implemented yet. Many fields accept \u201cposition,\u201d \u201cvision,\u201d or \u201ctheory\u201d papers on arXiv.\n- Do a minimal, honest prototype and call the results preliminary. Even a small synthetic-data demo with transparent limitations is fine for a v1 preprint you can update later.\n- Write a survey or systematization of existing work. High effort, but it demonstrates command of the area and is publishable as a preprint.\n- Do a reproducibility/replication study of a known result using open data/code. This can be faster than a full new method and is valuable.\n- Release an open-source implementation or dataset with a short application note. Demonstrates execution and impact.\n- Submit to a workshop/short-paper track. Many venues accept preliminary or conceptual work when it\u2019s clearly labeled as such.\n- Consider a registered report (in fields that support it): methods are peer-reviewed before data collection, showing rigor without completed experiments.\n\nHow to frame a proposal/vision preprint:\n- Title: signal it\u2019s a proposal (e.g., \u201cA Proposal for \u2026\u201d, \u201cA Conceptual Framework for \u2026\u201d, \u201cA Position Paper on \u2026\u201d).\n- Abstract: state explicitly that the work is unimplemented and lacks empirical evaluation; summarize the idea and planned tests.\n- Body:\n  - Motivation and gaps in prior work\n  - Method/algorithm with theory, complexity, expected behaviors, and failure modes\n  - Proposed evaluation plan: datasets, baselines, metrics, ablations, success criteria\n  - Limitations, risks, and required resources\n  - Optional: small simulations/thought experiments or proofs if relevant\n- Clearly label any \u201cexpected\u201d or \u201chypothetical\u201d results as such. Do not include fabricated numbers, plots, or tables.\n\nTips to get a credible minimal prototype fast:\n- Narrow the scope to a single core claim you can test on 1\u20132 standard datasets or a synthetic setup.\n- Use existing baselines/libraries; prioritize a fair but minimal comparison.\n- Report what you have, with caveats. \u201cPreliminary results\u201d is acceptable if accurate.\n\nHow to present this in your grad-school application:\n- List the arXiv preprint (proposal, survey, or preliminary-results paper) if you post it.\n- If not yet posted, don\u2019t list as a publication. Instead, describe the project in your statement, link to a code repo or draft, and have a recommender attest to the work and promise.\n- Emphasize fit, letters, and evidence of research ability; one honest, focused preprint beats a deceptive one.\n\nBottom line: Be fully transparent. You can absolutely share your idea on arXiv, but label it as a proposal or preliminary work and avoid any fabricated claims or results.",

Add a clear disclaimer: \u201cConceptual proposal; no empirical evaluation yet.\u201d\n- Day 7: Internal review (friend/mentor). Fix clarity/claims. Submit to arXiv.\n\nLanguage you can reuse (status clarity)\n- \u201cThis is a proposal/position paper; the method has not yet been implemented.\u201d\n- \u201cWe provide a preregistered evaluation plan and hypotheses to guide forthcoming experiments.\u201d\n- \u201cAny figures of system architecture are conceptual; no empirical plots are presented.\u201d\n\narXiv submission tips\n- Use a standard LaTeX template (e.g., arXiv generic or a common conference template marked \u2018preprint\u2019).\n- In arXiv comments, include: \u201cProposal/vision paper; empirical evaluation forthcoming.\u201d\n- Link your code repo. Choose a clear license.\n- Check your target venues\u2019 preprint policies if you plan to submit later.\n\nQuality checklist before posting\n- No fabricated results or performance claims.\n- Limitations and risks are explicit.\n- Evaluation plan is specific enough that someone else could run it.\n- Contributions match what\u2019s actually in the paper (conceptual, not empirical).\n- Figures and text don\u2019t imply completed experiments.\n\nIf you share your field (e.g., ML, bio, economics, HCI) and a one-paragraph idea, I can suggest concrete datasets, baselines, metrics, and a tailored evaluation plan you can drop in.",

Below are three concrete Option B projects. Each includes the idea, compute needs, experiment plan, and what the paper would claim. Pick one, and I\u2019ll draft the paper text and give you a repo scaffold you can run.\n\nOption B1: Adaptive Label Smoothing Schedule (ALS) for Better Calibration\n- Pitch: Replace fixed label smoothing with a tiny schedule that decays with training or adapts to validation miscalibration, improving ECE/NLL with neutral or slightly better accuracy.\n- Compute/time: 1\u00d7 T4/A10, CIFAR-10/100 with ResNet-18 and WideResNet-28-10. ~1\u20132 hours per run on CIFAR-10; 2\u20134 hours on CIFAR-100. 3 seeds \u00d7 3\u20134 settings is feasible in a weekend.\n- Datasets/models:\n  - CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.\n  - ResNet-18 (fast), WideResNet-28-10 (optional, slower).\n- Methods:\n  - Baselines: no smoothing; fixed \u03b5 \u2208 {0.05, 0.1, 0.2}.\n  - Our tweak: \u03b5_t uses either:\n    - Cosine decay: \u03b5_t = \u03b50 \u00b7 0.5 \u00b7 (1 + cos(\u03c0 t/T)), or\n    - Calibration-adaptive: \u03b5_t = clip(k \u00b7 ECE_valid(t), 0, \u03b5max).\n- Metrics:\n  - Top-1 accuracy, NLL, Brier score, ECE (with debiased binning), optionally CIFAR-C robustness and post-hoc temperature scaling.\n- Ablations:\n  - Different \u03b50/\u03b5max; decay schedules; with/without mixup; effect on WRN vs ResNet.\n- Paper claims:\n  - A tiny, drop-in schedule consistently improves calibration on CIFAR-100 and maintains accuracy, with negligible cost.\n- Related work anchors:\n  - Label smoothing (Szegedy et al., 2016), when it helps (M\u00fcller et al., 2019), calibration and temperature scaling (Guo et al., 2017).\n\nImplementation sketch (PyTorch)\n- Replace hard targets y with soft targets (1\u2212\u03b5) on the true class, \u03b5/(K\u22121) otherwise. Update \u03b5 each epoch from your schedule.\n\nOption B2: Entropy-Gated Test-Time Augmentation (EG-TTA)\n- Pitch: Apply TTA only to uncertain samples (high-entropy predictions), using a tiny pool of cheap augmentations; improves accuracy and calibration with ~1.2\u20131.5\u00d7 inference cost.\n- Compute/time: Train once (or use an off-the-shelf checkpoint). Evaluation-only trick is fast; perfect if compute is tight.\n- Datasets/models:\n  - CIFAR-10/100 or Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18 or MobileNetV2.\n- Methods:\n  - Baselines: no TTA; uniform TTA on all samples (e.g., 10-crop or light RandAugment).\n  - Our tweak: entropy gate threshold \u03c4; if H(p) \u2265 \u03c4, run a small set of augmentations A (e.g., {center-crop, horizontal flip, small brightness/contrast jitter}); average logits. Else, single pass.\n- Metrics:\n  - Top-1 accuracy, ECE/NLL; report average number of augmented passes per test example.\n- Ablations:\n  - Different \u03c4; different augmentation pools; per-class gating; effect on CIFAR-C corruptions.\n- Paper claims:\n  - A simple entropy gate recovers most of TTA\u2019s benefits at a fraction of its cost and improves calibration.\n- Related work anchors:\n  - Classic TTA and multi-crop, AugMix (Hendrycks et al., 2020), selective computation ideas.\n\nImplementation sketch (pseudo)\n- p = softmax(f(x)); if entropy(p) < \u03c4: return p\n- Else: compute logits on transforms in A; return softmax(mean(logits)).\n\nOption B3: LoRA vs Full Fine-Tuning Under Tight Budgets\n- Pitch: With small GPUs, LoRA (rank r) can match full fine-tuning on sentence classification while training faster and using less memory; simple protocol comparison with strong baselines.\n- Compute/time: 1\u00d7 T4; SST-2, MRPC, RTE using DistilBERT or RoBERTa-base; 30\u2013120 minutes per run.\n- Methods:\n  - Baselines: full fine-tuning; BitFit; adapters.\n  - Our tweak: systematic LoRA sweep (r \u2208 {4, 8, 16}, \u03b1 scaling, dropout), same hyper/time budgets, early stopping.\n- Metrics:\n  - Accuracy (SST-2/RTE), F1 (MRPC), training time, GPU memory, parameter count updated.\n- Ablations:\n  - Different seeds; low-data subsampling; mixed-precision vs full precision.\n- Paper claims:\n  - Clear trade-offs and a recommended default (e.g., LoRA r=8) for small-budget fine-tuning.\n- Related work anchors:\n  - LoRA (Hu et al., 2021), BitFit, adapters.\n\nPaper outline I\u2019ll fill in once you pick an option\n- Title (examples)\n  - ALS: \u201cAdaptive Label Smoothing Schedules Improve Calibration on CIFAR-100 with No Accuracy Loss\u201d\n  - EG-TTA: \u201cEntropy-Gated Test-Time Augmentation: Calibration and Accuracy at 1.3\u00d7 Inference Cost\u201d\n  - LoRA: \u201cLoRA vs. Full Fine-Tuning Under Small-Compute Budgets: A Simple Empirical Study\u201d\n- Abstract: Problem, simple tweak, datasets/models, headline findings, code link.\n- Introduction: Why this matters, gap, our contributions (bulleted).\n- Method: Precise definition of the tweak, hyperparameters, compute budget.\n- Experiments: Setup, baselines, results (mean \u00b1 std over 3 seeds), ablations, significance checks.\n- Discussion: Insights, limitations, when it helps/hurts, cost considerations.\n- Reproducibility: Seeds, hardware, configs, training scripts, commit hash.\n- Ethical considerations: Resource use and reporting.\n\nRepo scaffold I can generate\n- Structure\n  - configs/: YAMLs for datasets, models, training, and sweeps\n  - src/: data.py, model.py, train.py, eval.py, schedules.py (ALS or gate), metrics.py (ECE, NLL, Brier), tta.py (if EG-TTA)\n  - scripts/: run_baselines.sh, run_ours.sh, eval.sh\n  - notebooks/: quick sanity-checks and figure generation\n  - results/: CSVs and tables\n- Logging/rigor\n  - Deterministic seeds; log hardware, commit hash; 3 seeds per setting\n  - Metrics: mean \u00b1 std; paired t-test or bootstrap CIs\n  - Optional: W&B/MLflow integration for quick comparisons\n\nWhat I need from you\n- Your preference (ALS, EG-TTA, or LoRA)\n- Your compute (GPU type/count), timeline/deadline, and tolerance for runtime\n- Dataset choice (default: CIFAR-10/100 for vision; GLUE subsets for NLP)\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a preference, I recommend EG-TTA for the fastest turnaround or ALS for a clean, training-time tweak.

It\u2019s widely used in physics, math, computer science, statistics, and related fields.\n\nHow it differs from a blog\n- Content: Formal research manuscripts (PDFs), not opinion posts. Most are technical and aimed at specialists.\n- Review: arXiv is moderated for basic scholarly standards and relevance, but it is not peer\u2011reviewed. Many papers later appear in journals after peer review.\n- Format and indexing: Papers get a permanent arXiv identifier (e.g., arXiv:2401.01234), have versions (v1, v2, \u2026), and are citable. There are no comment threads/likes.\n- Access: Completely free to read and download.\n\nCan a \u201cregular person\u201d contribute?\n- Reading: Yes. Anyone can search, read, and subscribe to email alerts.\n- Submitting: Possibly, but there are hurdles:\n  - You need an arXiv account and to follow its policies (original research, proper citations, no plagiarism, appropriate subject area).\n  - Manuscripts should be scholarly in form (typically LaTeX-generated PDF), with abstract, references, and clear methods/arguments.\n  - Endorsement: Most first\u2011time authors must be endorsed by an existing arXiv author in the relevant subject area. This is a lightweight gate to keep out non-scholarly content. Once you\u2019ve published in a category, you usually don\u2019t need new endorsements there.\n  - Moderation: Even with endorsement, moderators can hold or reject work that doesn\u2019t meet minimum academic standards or fit the category.\n\nPractical tips if you want to try\n- Read a few papers in the category you\u2019re targeting to match expectations for structure and rigor.\n- Prepare your manuscript carefully (clear abstract, references, figures, methods).\n- Create an account at arxiv.org, check the submission and endorsement FAQs, and request endorsement if required.\n- Be ready for feedback to come informally (via email/Twitter) rather than through arXiv itself.\n\nCaveat as a reader\n- Because arXiv papers are not peer\u2011reviewed, treat them as provisional. Many are excellent and later appear in top journals; others may change significantly after review.",

An endorser is simply vouching that your manuscript is scholarly and belongs in the chosen category\u2014not that your results are correct.\n\nUse arXiv\u2019s own endorsement flow\n- Create an arXiv account and start a submission in the category you think fits.\n- If endorsement is required, arXiv will tell you and provide a way to request it. Follow the instructions on the endorsement page and read arxiv.org/help/endorsement.\n- Endorsement is per subject category; once endorsed for, say, cs.AI, you typically won\u2019t need it again for that category.\n\nPrepare before you ask\n- Make sure your manuscript looks like a research paper: clear abstract, intro, method/derivations, results, discussion, references. Keep claims proportional to evidence.\n- Use proper formatting (LaTeX is common) and include citations to relevant literature.\n\nFind potential endorsers\n- Search arXiv for recent papers closest to your topic in the relevant category.\n- Note active authors (recent uploads) who work on your specific niche\u2014especially at universities or research labs.\n- The corresponding authors of closely related arXiv papers are often good bets.\n\nHow to contact them\n- Many endorsers accept requests via arXiv\u2019s interface. You can also email directly. Keep it short and professional.\n- What to include:\n  - Who you are (e.g., independent researcher, practitioner in X).\n  - Title, 1\u20132 sentence summary of your contribution, and why it fits the category.\n  - Link to a clean PDF (or read-only Overleaf/GitHub link).\n  - The exact arXiv category you\u2019re targeting.\n  - Acknowledge that endorsement is about suitability/format, not agreement with your conclusions.\n\nSample email\n- Subject: Request for arXiv endorsement in [category] for \u201c[paper title]\u201d\n- Body: Hello Dr. [Name], I\u2019m an independent researcher working on [topic]. I\u2019ve prepared a manuscript intended for arXiv [category] that [one-sentence contribution]. Abstract below; PDF link: [URL]. Would you consider endorsing me for this category? I understand endorsement only indicates that the paper is scholarly and appropriately targeted. If you\u2019re unable, no worries\u2014thank you for your time. [Abstract] [Signature]\n\nExpectations and etiquette\n- Reach out to a small, targeted list (e.g., 5\u201310 people). Don\u2019t mass-email.\n- If someone declines or doesn\u2019t reply, move on politely.\n- Even with endorsement, moderators may still hold or reclassify submissions.\n\nAlternative routes if you\u2019re stuck\n- Collaborate with a researcher (local university seminars, online reading groups, open-source research projects). A coauthor can endorse you.\n- Verify an institutional or research-lab email on your arXiv account if you have one; some users are auto-cleared without endorsement.\n- Post a preprint on an open repository (e.g., OSF Preprints, Zenodo, or your website) while you seek endorsement, so endorsers can review a stable link.\n- If appropriate, submit to a journal first; a future coauthor or editor/reviewer you get to know may later endorse you (arXiv does not auto-endorse based on journal acceptance).\n\nIf you want, share your target category and a 2\u20133 sentence abstract, and I can suggest keywords, paper examples to reference, and a shortlist strategy for potential endorsers.",

          "content": "Congrats on getting this far. arXiv can be a good way to timestamp and get eyes on your work, but there are a few practical hurdles. Here\u2019s how to proceed.\n\nWhat arXiv is (and isn\u2019t)\n- It\u2019s a public preprint server, not peer review. There is light moderation for relevance/format.\n- Most physics categories require an endorsement from an existing arXiv author before your first submission in that area.\n\nStep-by-step\n1) Prepare a professional manuscript\n- Use LaTeX if you can; it\u2019s the norm in physics and compiles cleanly on arXiv. If you must use Word, export a high\u2011quality PDF (embed fonts).\n- Structure: abstract; intro with context and citations; your framework; derivations; comparison with existing results/data; testable predictions; limitations; references.\n- Be explicit about where you differ from established models and how your proposal meets known constraints (CMB, BBN, lensing/Bullet Cluster, structure formation, gravitational tests, collider bounds, etc.).\n- Figures: PDF/PNG/JPG (vector PDF preferred for plots). Keep file sizes modest.\n- If using BibTeX, upload the .bbl file so arXiv doesn\u2019t have to run biber/bibtex.\n- Keep tone neutral; avoid big claims in the title/abstract without support.\n\n2) Choose a category\n- Likely candidates: physics.gen-ph (General Physics), gr-qc (General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology), or hep-th (High Energy Theory), possibly cross-list to astro-ph.CO if there\u2019s cosmology content.\n- Pick the primary category that best matches the technical methods you use. You can request cross-listing to one or two others.\n\n3) Create an arXiv account\n- Register at arxiv.org, verify your email, fill in your profile. ORCID is optional but helpful.\n\n4) Endorsement\n- Most physics categories require an endorser for your first submission in that category.\n- On the submission page, arXiv will show a \u201cRequest endorsement\u201d link and a list/search for potential endorsers in the chosen category.\n- How to ask: send a short, professional email including title, abstract, a PDF draft, and why the paper fits that category. Be concise and polite. Example:\n  - Subject: arXiv endorsement request for [category]\n  - Body: 3\u20135 sentences: who you are (independent researcher is fine), what the paper does, why it belongs in that category, and a link to the draft. Thank them regardless.\n- You can also seek an endorser by getting feedback from a local university seminar, mailing list, or a researcher whose recent arXiv papers are close to your topic.\n\n5) Submit\n- Upload source (preferred) or PDF. Fill metadata (title, authors, abstract, comments like \u201c18 pages, 3 figures,\u201d and subject classes).\n- Choose a license (CC BY 4.0 is common; arXiv\u2019s default license is also fine).\n- Check the compilation/preview, fix any errors, then finalize.\n- Timing: submissions before about 14:00 US Eastern usually appear the next weekday; moderation can delay this.\n\n6) Moderation and outcomes\n- Your paper may be accepted, re-categorized, or put on hold. If declined, you\u2019ll get a brief reason; appeals rarely overturn decisions unless it\u2019s a clear mistake.\n- You can upload revised versions (v2, v3, \u2026) later.\n\nIf you can\u2019t get endorsed or are moderated out\n- Post a preprint on an open repository that gives you a DOI and timestamp, then use that to seek feedback and an eventual arXiv endorser:\n  - Zenodo.org\n  - OSF Preprints (osf.io/preprints)\n  - Figshare\n- These are widely indexed and let you share a stable link. viXra exists but is generally not taken seriously by most physicists.\n\nWays to improve your chances\n- Anchor your work in the literature: cite standard texts and recent peer\u2011reviewed papers; show you understand \u039bCDM/SM basics and known constraints.\n- Provide clear, checkable predictions or calculations that distinguish your proposal from existing models.\n- Dimensional analysis and consistency checks (Lorentz/gauge invariance if relevant, conservation laws, known limits).\n- Ask a physicist to sanity\u2011check the draft before submission.\n- Include a brief, readable 1\u20132 page summary to share with potential endorsers.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Help pick the best category and draft the abstract.\n- Convert or clean up your LaTeX.\n- Draft a concise endorsement request email.\n- Make a pre\u2011submission checklist tailored to your paper.",

Starting from an action S = \u222b\u221a\u2212g [R + LU(\u03a6i, A\u03bc)], the gauge group GU \u2192 GSM \u00d7 Gd breaks spontaneously, leaving a neutral, stable state \u03c7 protected by a residual Z2 symmetry. \u03c7 interacts gravitationally and via a suppressed portal coupling \u03b5 to visible matter. We derive the background cosmology and linear perturbations, compute the relic abundance via [freeze-out/freeze-in], and show consistency with BBN and Planck constraints for couplings \u03b5 \u2264 [value]. The model reproduces \u039bCDM expansion history and lensing on large scales, while predicting a small-scale feature in the matter power spectrum at k \u2248 [value] h/Mpc and a self-interaction cross section \u03c3\u03c7\u03c7/m\u03c7 \u2248 [range], testable with forthcoming weak-lensing and cluster surveys. We outline parameter ranges and observational tests that can falsify the framework.\n\nAbstract draft B \u2014 modified gravity/unified geometry (gr-qc or gen-ph; cross-list astro-ph.CO)\nWe present a unified geometric theory in which General Relativity is extended by an additional field sector that couples to curvature and mimics cold dark-matter phenomenology on galactic and cosmological scales. From the action S = \u222b\u221a\u2212g [R + Lgeom(g\u03bc\u03bd, X\u03bc/\u03c6)], variation yields modified Einstein equations with an effective stress\u2013energy T\u03bc\u03bd,eff sourced by [vector/scalar] degrees of freedom. In the homogeneous limit the model reproduces the \u039bCDM expansion history; linear perturbations match CMB acoustic peaks and growth data for [parameter range], while Solar-System dynamics satisfy PPN bounds via [screening/decoupling mechanism]. We obtain rotation curves and weak-lensing profiles without invoking particle dark matter, and we identify a distinctive scale-dependent slip \u03b7(k, z) and growth index \u03b3 = [value] that differentiate the theory from \u039bCDM. Current datasets bound the coupling to [range]; near-term surveys can confirm or exclude the model through lensing E/B-mode ratios and redshift-space distortions.\n\nHow to customize quickly\n- Replace bracketed items ([\u2026]) with your concrete details: field content (scalar/vector/tensor), symmetry names (GU, Z2), mechanism (freeze-out/freeze-in or screening), any key parameter names and ranges, and one or two specific, testable predictions (a k-scale feature, cross-section range, growth index).\n- Keep to ~130\u2013160 words.\n- Tone: \u201cwe propose / we derive / we show consistency\u201d rather than \u201cprove\u201d or \u201csolve.\u201d\n\nNext step\n- Tell me which abstract (A or B) fits your work and your preferred title (or tweak one).\n- Provide any specific numbers/terms you can include (e.g., \u201cZ2,\u201d \u201cfreeze-in,\u201d \u201ck \u2248 5 h/Mpc,\u201d \u201c\u03b5 \u2264 10^\u221210,\u201d \u201cscreening via chameleon\u201d).\n- Pick a primary category:\n  - hep-th if the unification is formal/field-theoretic\n  - gr-qc if the focus is on gravity/geometry and tests\n  - gen-ph if it\u2019s broad and methodological\n  - cross-list to astro-ph.CO if there\u2019s cosmology\n\nOnce you choose, I\u2019ll:\n- Finalize the abstract (polished and specific)\n- Slot it and your title into a ready-to-send endorsement request email tailored to the category.",

A few points to maximize credibility and avoid common pitfalls:\n\nPick the right server\n- For clinical or population-health claims, medRxiv is what most medical professionals watch. It has screening (ethics, human data, appropriateness), which adds credibility. BioRxiv is for biology; arXiv is less read by clinicians unless it\u2019s methods (statistics, ML, medical physics).\n- If your work is mainly a statistical/methods reanalysis, arXiv (stat.ME/stat.AP), plus medRxiv for the applied version, can work. Many authors dual-post (method on arXiv, applied study on medRxiv).\n\nDecide your article type and reporting standard\n- New data analysis (observational): follow STROBE (plus RECORD if using EHR/claims), include a clear causal diagram if making causal claims, and pre-specify endpoints if possible.\n- Systematic review/meta-analysis: follow PRISMA; include search strategy, inclusion criteria, risk-of-bias assessment.\n- Prediction model: TRIPOD.\n- Diagnostic accuracy: STARD.\n- Hypothesis/perspective (no new data): be explicit it\u2019s a hypothesis, outline testable predictions, avoid clinical recommendations.\n\nEvidence, ethics, and methods\n- If you used human subjects data, ensure IRB approval or a documented exemption and data-use compliance. medRxiv will ask for this; arXiv won\u2019t, but reviewers will.\n- Use robust stats: specify a priori analysis plan, correct for multiple testing, include sensitivity analyses, negative controls/falsification tests, and discuss confounding and reverse causality. Share code and a reproducible workflow.\n- Check novelty rigorously: search synonyms, MeSH terms, and preprints; a medical librarian or domain expert consult is invaluable.\n\nWrite for credibility\n- IMRaD structure, neutral tone, modest claims. State limitations clearly and discuss alternative explanations.\n- No clinical advice; if implications exist, frame them as hypotheses requiring trial-level evidence.\n- Include: data/code availability, ethics/IRB statement (or exemption), funding, and competing interests.\n\nSubmission basics\n- medRxiv: create account, choose category, upload manuscript (PDF/Word), plus statements above. They screen for appropriateness and risk of harm.\n- arXiv: create account, choose the best category, compile to PDF (LaTeX via Overleaf is common), pick a license, and you may need an endorser in that category. You can request endorsement or contact authors who\u2019ve posted there to endorse you.\n- Consider also OSF Preprints or Research Square if medRxiv isn\u2019t a fit.\n\nGetting taken seriously\n- Coauthor or at least consult with a clinician/biostatistician; even limited advisory input strengthens the work.\n- Share code/data; invite open peer review (e.g., PREreview) and ask specific experts for comments.\n- After preprint, target an appropriate peer\u2011reviewed journal; tailor to the journal\u2019s scope and checklist.\n\nIf you want, I can help:\n- Map your idea to the right article type and server.\n- Draft an outline (IMRaD) with the correct reporting checklist.\n- sanity\u2011check for common causal/statistical red flags.\n- Prepare a submission checklist for medRxiv/arXiv.\n\nTo tailor advice, could you share:\n1) Is this a new data analysis, a reanalysis of public data, a systematic review, or a hypothesis piece?\n2) Does it involve human subjects data (and if so, what approvals/exemptions you have)?\n3) Who is the primary audience (clinicians in which specialty, epidemiologists, statisticians)?\n4) A one\u2011paragraph summary of the \u201cconnection\u201d and the key evidence supporting it.",

Animal models show microglial activation and BBB disruption with particulate exposure. Natural experiments (traffic/coal plant closures) suggest cognitive benefits following PM reductions. Counter-evidence includes null findings in small cohorts with coarse exposure data.\n- Predictions: (1) In Medicare and UK Biobank, a 5 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 higher long-term PM2.5 will associate with ~8\u201312% higher dementia incidence after adjusting for SES, smoking, and comorbidity. (2) Plasma neurofilament light and inflammatory cytokines will increase with modeled PM2.5 in repeated-measures cohorts.

          "content": "Short answer: there isn\u2019t a legitimate \u201cworkaround\u201d to skip arXiv\u2019s endorsement. But you can get endorsed even if you don\u2019t personally know anyone. Here\u2019s how to do it quickly and ethically.\n\nWhat endorsement is\n- It\u2019s a lightweight gate to deter spam. Once you\u2019re endorsed for a subject area, you can submit there in the future.\n\nFastest legitimate paths\n1) Use arXiv\u2019s built\u2011in \u201cFind an endorser\u201d tool\n- Create an arXiv account and start a submission in the correct primary subject class.\n- If endorsement is required, arXiv will show a \u201cFind an endorser\u201d link for that category.\n- It lists eligible endorsers (people who\u2019ve posted in that area). Pick a few whose recent papers are close to your topic.\n\n2) Ask for an endorsement the right way\n- Send a short, professional request. Include:\n  - Your arXiv username and the exact subject class (e.g., cs.LG, math.PR).\n  - Title, 3\u20136 sentence abstract, and why you\u2019re contacting them specifically.\n  - A link to a clean PDF (or the arXiv submission preview link if available).\n  - One sentence confirming originality and fit to the category.\n- Keep it brief, targeted, and polite. Don\u2019t mass\u2011email; try 3\u20135 well\u2011matched people. Give a week to respond, one gentle follow\u2011up max.\n\nExample email (trim to fit):\n- Subject: arXiv endorsement request for [category]: \u201c[Title]\u201d\n- Hi Dr. X, I\u2019m submitting the attached preprint to arXiv in [category]. Your recent work on [very short, specific] is close to ours, so I hoped you might consider endorsing. Abstract: [5 sentences]. PDF: [link]. My arXiv username: [name]. If it looks appropriate, I\u2019d be grateful for an endorsement; if not, no worries. Thank you.\n\n3) Ask a coauthor or mentor to be the submitting author\n- If any coauthor already has endorsement in that category, they can be the submitting author for the paper. You personally don\u2019t need endorsement in that case.\n\n4) If stuck, contact arXiv support\n- If you\u2019ve tried the above and genuinely can\u2019t find an endorser, use arXiv\u2019s Contact/Help form. Briefly explain your situation, provide the abstract and subject class, and ask for guidance. They may point you to endorsers or advise next steps.\n\nMake it easy to say \u201cyes\u201d\n- Choose the correct category and follow arXiv policies (scope, formatting, plagiarism).\n- Use standard LaTeX formatting; include references and clear contributions.\n- Post a stable PDF (no sharing\u2011locked links), and include your ORCID on the title page or arXiv profile.\n\nWhat not to do\n- Don\u2019t miscategorize to avoid endorsement. Moderators will flag/move it, and it can hurt your chances.\n- Don\u2019t fabricate affiliations or endorsements.\n- Don\u2019t spam dozens of authors.\n\nIf you can\u2019t wait: alternatives to establish a public timestamp\n- Zenodo or Figshare (general repositories, assign DOIs).\n- OSF Preprints or a topical OSF community (e.g., SocArXiv, PsyArXiv, engrXiv), if your field fits.\n- HAL (widely used in some regions and disciplines).\nThese are fine for visibility and priority, but in some communities arXiv is still the standard, so consider these as interim steps while you secure an arXiv endorsement.\n\nTypical timeline\n- Identify 3\u20135 close\u2011match endorsers: 30\u201360 minutes.\n- Send requests: same day.\n- Responses: a few days to a week; try a second small batch if no replies.\n\nIf you tell me your field and subject class, I can help you:\n- Draft a category\u2011specific request,\n- Identify 5\u201310 likely endorsers from recent arXiv submissions,\n- Sanity\u2011check your abstract for category fit.",

It\u2019s not a blog or forum.\n   - Use a clear structure: abstract, intro/background with citations, method/argument, results or analysis, discussion, references.\n   - Keep claims precise and checkable; cite relevant literature.\n\n2) Prepare files\n   - arXiv prefers LaTeX source + figures; PDF alone is accepted but less ideal.\n   - Many people use Overleaf\u2019s arXiv templates.\n   - Include your real name and contact email. An ORCID iD helps.\n\n3) Create an arXiv account and pick a subject category\n   - Choose the best-fit category (e.g., physics, math, cs; there are expository categories like physics.pop-ph and math.HO).\n   - You\u2019ll choose a license (e.g., CC BY).\n\n4) Endorsement (for most first-time authors)\n   - Many categories require a one-time endorsement from an existing arXiv author in that area.\n   - arXiv provides a \u201crequest endorsement\u201d step; you can also politely email potential endorsers with a short abstract, who you are, and a link to a draft.\n   - Coauthoring with someone already endorsed also works. After you\u2019re endorsed once, you can usually submit in that category without repeating this.\n\n5) Moderation\n   - arXiv is not peer reviewed, but moderators screen for minimal scholarly standards and correct scope. Misplaced or purely speculative work may be rejected or reclassified.\n   - If declined, you\u2019ll get a brief reason and can revise or try a more appropriate venue.\n\nTips to increase your chances:\n- Ground your ideas in existing literature and explain how yours differs.\n- Avoid grand unified \u201ctheories of everything\u201d without math/derivations or testable consequences.\n- Keep it concise; have someone technically literate read it for clarity.\n- If your piece is meant for a general audience, consider the \u201cpopular/expository\u201d category where available\u2014but it still must be accurate and sourced.\n\nAlternatives if endorsement is a hurdle:\n- OSF Preprints, Zenodo, figshare (assign DOIs, no endorsement). These are good for getting a citable, time-stamped public draft while you seek feedback.\n- Personal website or GitHub for drafts and data/code.\n\nIf you want, describe your topic and target field, and I can suggest a suitable arXiv category and help outline the paper so it fits arXiv norms.",

If you share more specifics, I can tailor it further.\n\nProvisional title\nRecurring Patterns in Quantum Mechanics: Symmetry, Spectra, and Information\n\nAbstract (about 180 words)\nThis expository article catalogs recurring patterns that appear across quantum systems and traces them to a small set of structural principles. Symmetries and their representations organize states and spectra\u2014from SU(2) spin addition and selection rules to degeneracies protected by time-reversal and spatial invariances. Operator algebras and commutators generate families of solvable models, including ladder-operator constructions for the harmonic oscillator and angular momentum, along with uncertainty relations and their generalizations. Information-theoretic constraints shape multipartite correlations, highlighting entanglement structure, Bell inequality violations, and monogamy. In complex systems, statistical universality emerges in energy-level fluctuations via random-matrix statistics and connects to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Using textbook case studies (spin-1/2, harmonic oscillator, hydrogen) and simple many-body examples, we show how these themes recur in seemingly unrelated contexts and point to unifying tools such as Wigner\u2019s theorem, Noether-type arguments, and POVMs. The goal is to provide a map for readers encountering quantum mechanics from diverse backgrounds: what to look for, why certain patterns are ubiquitous, and where they break down. The presentation is self-contained, mathematically careful but accessible, and extensively referenced to standard texts and review articles.\n\nRecommended arXiv category\nphysics.pop-ph (Popular Physics). Rationale: this is an accurate, sourced, broadly accessible survey with minimal new claims. Keep the tone expository, include citations for every claim, and avoid speculative interpretations.\n\nIf you decide to include new derivations or simulations, I can rewrite the abstract for quant-ph and adjust the framing accordingly.",

Symmetries and their representations organize states and spectra\u2014from SU(2) spin addition and selection rules to degeneracies protected by time-reversal and spatial invariances. Operator algebras and commutators generate families of solvable models, including ladder-operator constructions for the harmonic oscillator and angular momentum, along with uncertainty relations and their generalizations. Information-theoretic constraints shape multipartite correlations, highlighting entanglement structure, Bell inequality violations, and monogamy. In complex systems, statistical universality emerges in energy-level fluctuations via random-matrix statistics and connects to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Using textbook case studies (spin-1/2, harmonic oscillator, hydrogen) and simple many-body examples, we show how these themes recur in seemingly unrelated contexts and point to unifying tools such as Wigner\u2019s theorem, Noether-type arguments, and positive-operator-valued measures. The goal is to provide a map for readers encountering quantum mechanics from diverse backgrounds: what to look for, why certain patterns are ubiquitous, and where they break down. The presentation is self-contained, mathematically careful but accessible, and referenced to standard texts and review articles.\n\nKeywords\nsymmetry; representation theory; operator algebras; spectral degeneracy; entanglement; random matrices; eigenstate thermalization; measurement; POVMs\n\n1. Introduction\nQuantum mechanics is often introduced through a sequence of \u201cexamples that work\u201d: spin-1/2, the harmonic oscillator, the hydrogen atom, two-level systems in a field. The same themes recur across these examples\u2014symmetries, algebraic constructions, spectral regularities, and characteristic statistical behaviors. This article collects those recurring patterns and ties them to a small set of principles that help explain both why the patterns arise and where they stop applying.\n\nContributions:\n- A coherent map of patterns that reappear across distinct quantum systems.\n- Concrete case studies linking those patterns to symmetries, operator algebras, and information-theoretic constraints.\n- Pointers to unifying tools and standard sources for deeper reading.\n\nScope and audience:\n- Expository and self-contained, aimed at readers who know basic linear algebra and the Dirac notation but not necessarily advanced field theory.\n- No new physics is claimed; all statements are sourced to textbooks or review articles.\n\nOutline:\nSection 2 lays out structural principles. Sections 3\u20137 cover symmetry patterns, operator/commutator methods, spectral regularities, entanglement and information, and universality in complex systems. Section 8 discusses measurement and statistical predictions. Section 9 notes limitations and where patterns break down. Section 10 distills a practical checklist for analyzing new models. Section 11 concludes.\n\n2. Structural principles that generate patterns\n- Linearity and Hilbert space: States are rays in a complex Hilbert space; dynamics are linear. This forces superposition and interference.\n- Observables and algebras: Physical quantities correspond to self-adjoint operators. Their commutators encode constraints (e.g., position-momentum, angular momentum).\n- Symmetries and representations: Symmetries act as unitary or antiunitary maps (Wigner\u2019s theorem). Continuous symmetries imply generators and conservation laws; discrete symmetries constrain spectra and selection rules.\n- Composition and locality: Composite systems use tensor products. Local interactions produce characteristic entanglement structures.\n- Measurement as probability assignment: Born\u2019s rule connects state vectors to outcome probabilities; generalized measurements (POVMs) unify many experimental procedures.\n- Scale and complexity: In many-body limits, fine details wash out and universal statistics emerge.\n\nThese ingredients repeatedly produce recognizable mathematical and empirical signatures.\n\n3. Symmetry patterns: how invariances organize states\n- Rotations and SU(2): Spin and orbital angular momentum furnish SU(2) representations labeled by j = 0, 1/2, 1, \u2026 with 2j+1 magnetic sublevels. Adding angular momenta produces the characteristic multiplicity pattern governed by Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients. Selection rules for dipole transitions (\u0394l = \u00b11, \u0394m = 0, \u00b11) follow from symmetry.\n- Degeneracy from symmetry: Conserved quantities commute with the Hamiltonian and block-diagonalize it. Degenerate multiplets appear when symmetry generators do not all commute with one another but leave H invariant (e.g., spherical symmetry).\n- Accidental symmetry: Hydrogen\u2019s bound-state spectrum has an enlarged SO(4) symmetry generated by angular momentum and the Laplace\u2013Runge\u2013Lenz vector, yielding higher degeneracies than rotational symmetry alone.\n- Time-reversal and Kramers degeneracy: For systems with half-integer total spin and time-reversal symmetry with T^2 = \u22121 (and no magnetic field), every level is at least doubly degenerate.\n- Translation and periodicity: In crystals, discrete translation symmetry implies Bloch waves with crystal momentum labels and band structures periodic in reciprocal space.\n\nTakeaway: Identify the symmetry group, its representations, and how the Hamiltonian sits inside that representation. Much of the spectrum and allowed transitions follow.\n\n4. Operator and commutator patterns: algebras that solve models\n- Canonical commutation: The Heisenberg algebra [x, p] = i\u0127 implies uncertainty relations and forbids simultaneous eigenstates. It also enables algebraic solution strategies.\n- Ladder operators and solvable models:\n  - Harmonic oscillator: Defining a and a\u2020 simplifies H to \u0127\u03c9(a\u2020a + 1/2), producing evenly spaced levels and coherent states with classical-like dynamics.\n  - Angular momentum: J\u00b1 raise and lower m while preserving j, encoding selection rules and matrix elements via the Wigner\u2013Eckart theorem.\n- Coherent and squeezed states: Minimizers of uncertainty relations form families with stable dynamics under quadratic Hamiltonians.\n- Algebraic closure: When commutators of the relevant operators close in a small algebra (Heisenberg, SU(2), SU(1,1)), one often gets exact spectra and matrix elements without differential equations.\n\nTakeaway: When an operator algebra closes, try to solve the problem algebraically before turning to numerics.\n\n5. Spectral patterns: degeneracies, splitting, and organization\n- Multiplet structure: Spherical symmetry groups states by l and m; adding spin creates fine and hyperfine structure with predictable splitting when weak symmetry-breaking terms are added.\n- Hydrogen vs. oscillator: Hydrogen has degeneracies scaling with principal quantum number n due to SO(4); the oscillator has equal spacing because of its algebra.\n- Perturbations and selection rules: Weak fields (Zeeman, Stark) break symmetries in controlled ways. First-order shifts are determined by symmetry-allowed matrix elements; forbidden transitions remain zero to all orders if ruled out by symmetry.\n- Addition of angular momentum: The triangle rule and Clebsch\u2013Gordan tables dictate which total-J irreps appear and with what multiplicity, a pervasive organizational pattern in atomic, nuclear, and particle spectra.\n\nTakeaway: Spectral regularities are often \u201cshadow images\u201d of underlying symmetries; controlled perturbations reveal the symmetry hierarchy.\n\n6. Information and entanglement patterns\n- Schmidt decomposition: Any pure state of a bipartite system can be expressed as a sum of orthogonal product states with nonnegative coefficients. This explains why reduced states look mixed and quantifies bipartite entanglement.\n- No-cloning and monogamy: Linear evolution forbids perfect copying of unknown states, and strong entanglement between A and B limits entanglement of A with C (monogamy). These constraints shape quantum networks and error correction.\n- Bell inequalities and nonlocal correlations: Measurements on entangled pairs violate classical constraints (e.g., CHSH), yet no-signaling is preserved. Experimental violations are a robust, reproducible pattern across platforms.\n- Entropic uncertainty: Incompatible measurements obey lower bounds on joint predictability. Entropic forms sharpen and generalize variance-based relations.\n- Area laws and typicality: Ground states of gapped, local 1D Hamiltonians obey area-law entanglement; highly excited states typically obey volume-law entanglement, consistent with quantum thermalization arguments.\n\nTakeaway: Information-theoretic constraints are not add-ons; they are structural consequences of linearity and the tensor-product composition of systems.\n\n7. Universality in complex systems: random matrices and thermalization\n- Level statistics: Complex, chaotic quantum systems exhibit level repulsion and universal spacing distributions described by random-matrix ensembles. Symmetry class dictates the ensemble (orthogonal, unitary, symplectic), while integrable systems show Poisson statistics.\n- Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH): For nonintegrable many-body systems, expectation values of few-body observables in individual eigenstates match microcanonical predictions. ETH explains why closed quantum systems appear to thermalize at the level of observables.\n- Exceptions and structure: Integrable models have extensive conserved quantities; many-body localization in strong disorder suppresses thermalization and restores Poisson-like spectra.\n\nTakeaway: At large scales and high complexity, fine details of the Hamiltonian become irrelevant; symmetry class and locality determine universal signatures.\n\n8. Measurement and statistical patterns\n- Born rule and POVMs: The probability of outcome i is given by the trace rule p(i) = Tr(\u03c1 Ei), where {Ei} are positive operators summing to identity. Projective measurements are a special case; POVMs capture realistic detectors, unsharp measurements, and multistep procedures.\n- Naimark dilation: Any POVM can be modeled as a projective measurement on a larger Hilbert space, unifying many experimental setups within the same formalism.\n- Constraints from structure: Gleason-type theorems show that, under broad conditions, any consistent assignment of probabilities to measurement outcomes must take the Born form, strongly constraining viable alternatives.\n\nTakeaway: The statistics of outcomes are not arbitrary; linearity, noncontextuality assumptions, and the geometry of state space severely restrict them.\n\n9. Where the patterns break down or change\n- Symmetry breaking and anomalies: Spontaneous symmetry breaking changes spectra and selection rules; explicit breaking (fields, boundaries) lifts degeneracies. In high-energy contexts, quantum anomalies can obstruct classical symmetries.\n- Open systems and decoherence: Coupling to environments moves dynamics from unitary to completely positive maps, modifying conservation laws and steady states while explaining classical-like outcomes.\n- Integrability vs chaos: Features like Poisson level statistics and nonthermal steady states in integrable or many-body localized systems are genuine departures from chaotic-universal behavior.\n- Finite size and energy scales: Small systems or extreme parameter regimes can exhibit crossovers where a \u201cfamiliar\u201d pattern no longer applies.\n\n10. A practical checklist for spotting patterns\nWhen you meet a new quantum model:\n- Identify symmetries: What is the symmetry group? Any antiunitary symmetries? What irreps label states?\n- Look for algebraic closure: Do key operators close under commutators (Heisenberg, SU(2), SU(1,1))?\n- Classify spectra: Are there obvious degeneracies? How do weak perturbations split them? Do selection rules explain observed zeros?\n- Diagnose entanglement: What does the Schmidt spectrum look like for subsystems? Is there area- or volume-law scaling?\n- Anticipate statistics: Given symmetries, expect GOE/GUE/GSE level statistics or Poisson; check numerically when possible.\n- Model measurements: Which POVMs represent the experimental readout? What constraints do they impose?\n\n11. Conclusion\nAcross quantum systems, a small set of structural ingredients\u2014symmetries and their representations, operator algebras, and information-theoretic constraints\u2014generate a wide array of recurring patterns. Recognizing these themes compresses complexity: it tells us what to expect, how to organize calculations, and where to look when something unusual appears. The same perspective clarifies the boundaries: when symmetries are broken, when integrability dominates, or when openness to an environment reshapes dynamics, the patterns morph in predictable ways. We hope this map helps readers navigate both textbook models and contemporary research.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI thank readers and colleagues for feedback on early drafts and pointers to references.

Recognizing these themes compresses complexity: it tells us what to expect, how to organize calculations, and where to look when something unusual appears. The same perspective clarifies the boundaries: when symmetries are broken, when integrability dominates, or when openness to an environment reshapes dynamics, the patterns morph in predictable ways. We hope this map helps readers navigate both textbook models and contemporary research.\n\n\\paragraph{Acknowledgments.}\nI thank readers and colleagues for feedback on early drafts and pointers to references.

Here\u2019s a practical, fast path.\n\n1) Do a quick sanity check before you rush\n- Many \u201cerrors\u201d in GR reduce to conventions: metric signature (+\u2212\u2212\u2212 vs \u2212+++), Riemann/Ricci sign conventions, 8\u03c0G and c=1 factors, index placement, or cosmological-constant terms. Cross-check against at least two standard references (e.g., Wald, Carroll, MTW, Weinberg).\n- Make sure your result survives coordinate changes and reduces to known limits (Newtonian, Schwarzschild, FRW, weak field).\n- Replace \u201conline calculators\u201d with a transparent derivation. If you used CAS (Mathematica/Maple), include the steps or a notebook as ancillary material.\n\n2) Write a concise paper\n- Structure: Abstract, Introduction (context/literature), Setup/Conventions, Main derivation, Consistency checks, Implications, Conclusion.\n- Cite the standard literature and explain exactly how your result differs and why past derivations miss it.\n- Be precise and conservative in claims; show testable consequences if any.\n\n3) Prepare the files for arXiv\n- Use LaTeX (article or revtex4-2). Include only supported packages; avoid anything needing shell-escape (e.g., minted).\n- Figures: PDF/PNG/JPG (vector PDF preferred). No external downloads.\n- Bibliography: either upload .bbl or ensure arXiv can run BibTeX; test a clean compile locally with pdflatex.\n- Put \\pdfoutput=1 at top if you rely on pdflatex.\n- You\u2019ll upload source (tex, figs, bbl/bib) as a single .zip/.tar.gz. arXiv doesn\u2019t accept Word.\n\n4) Create your arXiv account\n- Register at arXiv, verify email, add your real name, affiliation (if any), and ORCID.\n\n5) Get endorsement (often required for physics)\n- Pick a primary category:\n  - gr-qc (General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology) is likely.\n  - If it\u2019s mainly mathematical structure, math-ph or math.DG may fit.\n  - Avoid misplacing it; moderators will reclassify or can reject.\n- In the submission flow, arXiv will tell you if endorsement is needed and provide a \u201cfind endorser\u201d link.\n- How to get endorsed:\n  - Ask a researcher who has recent submissions in that category (former instructor, local faculty, or someone who\u2019s published on closely related topics). Send a short, polite email with your title, abstract, and a PDF.\n  - Use the arXiv endorser tool to identify eligible endorsers; follow their guidance and don\u2019t mass-mail.\n  - Having a coauthor who is already endorsed also works.\n\n6) Submit\n- Upload source, pick license (CC BY 4.0 is common), choose subject class(es), add an informative abstract, and optional comments (e.g., \u201c12 pages, 2 figures\u201d).\n- Cross-list to a secondary category if appropriate.\n- Watch for compilation errors; fix and resubmit if needed.\n- Moderation takes from hours to a couple of days. If accepted, it will appear in the next announcement cycle.\n\n7) After posting\n- Be ready for scrutiny. If errors are found, post a v2 promptly.\n- You can link code/derivations as \u201cancillary files\u201d or on a stable repository (e.g., Zenodo, GitHub) and cite them.\n\nIf you can\u2019t get endorsement quickly\n- Seek a collaborator/mentor with arXiv history.\n- As a temporary measure, you can deposit a preprint on a general repository with DOIs (e.g., Zenodo or OSF) to timestamp your result, then pursue arXiv endorsement.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste your abstract and intended category, and I can help you tighten the framing and check for the common GR convention pitfalls before you submit.",

We show that, when the variation of the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action is performed with the Gibbons\u2013Hawking\u2013York boundary term and mixed boundary conditions, a term conventionally discarded contributes a correction that modifies the field equations by [state the precise change here]. We compare this expression to standard textbook forms and trace the origin of the discrepancy to [clearly state the step]. Consistency checks are provided: the corrected equations satisfy the contracted Bianchi identity, imply \u2207^\u03bcT_{\u03bc\u03bd}=0, reproduce the Newtonian limit \u2207^2\u03a6=4\u03c0G\u03c1, and retain standard weak-field/PPN parameters. We also examine Schwarzschild and spatially flat FRW solutions under the corrected form. We discuss whether the correction is removable by a convention/parameter redefinition, and outline potential observational consequences if not.\n\n3) Minimal BibTeX file (optional, but common)\n---------------------------------------------\nFile: refs.bib\n@book{Wald,\n  author = {Wald, Robert M.},\n  title = {General Relativity},\n  year = {1984},\n  publisher = {University of Chicago Press}\n}\n@book{Carroll,\n  author = {Carroll, Sean M.},\n  title = {Spacetime and Geometry},\n  year = {2004},\n  publisher = {Cambridge University Press}\n}\n\nTip: run pdflatex \u2192 bibtex \u2192 pdflatex \u2192 pdflatex locally, then upload both main.tex and the generated refs.bbl.

          "content": "Short answer: You can try to post something on arXiv, but arXiv won\u2019t give you a DOI for it. If you need a DOI, you should deposit the work in a repository that mints DOIs (e.g., Zenodo, OSF, Figshare, or an institutional repository). A common approach is: put a concise paper on arXiv for visibility, and host the full book where it gets a DOI, then cross-link them.\n\nKey points about arXiv\n- arXiv is for scholarly research articles, not books. Long monographs and lecture-note\u2013style submissions sometimes get accepted, but \u201cbook\u201d submissions and highly speculative content are often screened or declined. There\u2019s moderation and you may need an endorser to submit in a category.\n- Format it like a research paper (abstract, intro, methods/arguments, references). A 200-page PDF is technically fine, but length doesn\u2019t guarantee acceptance.\n- arXiv does not mint DOIs for e-prints. You get an arXiv ID (e.g., arXiv:2501.01234). If the work is later published elsewhere, you can add that DOI to the arXiv record.\n\nHow to get a DOI right now\n- Zenodo (free, run by CERN): Upload your PDF, select \u201cPublication type: Book/Monograph,\u201d add metadata, choose a license (e.g., CC BY 4.0), publish. You immediately get a DOI and can version later.\n- OSF / OSF Preprints: Create a preprint; OSF mints a DOI and hosts the PDF. Light screening.\n- Figshare: Public items get DOIs; fill in full metadata and license.\n- Institutional repository: Many university libraries will host a monograph and mint a DOI for affiliates.\n- Preprints.org (MDPI): Issues DOIs for preprints after basic checks.\n\nA practical publication strategy\n1) Deposit the full 200-page book on Zenodo (or OSF/Figshare/institutional) to get a DOI.\n2) Write a concise, paper-length summary (10\u201320 pages) of your main claims, methods, and comparisons to existing literature. Submit that to arXiv in the most appropriate category (often physics.gen-ph for \u201ctheory of everything\u201d type work). In the arXiv submission, add a \u201cComments\u201d line and references pointing to the DOI of the full monograph. You can also attach the full book as an ancillary file on arXiv, but it still won\u2019t have a DOI there.\n3) Cite the DOI of the monograph in your own work. Example citation:\n- Your Name (2026). Title of the Book. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx\n\nTips to improve arXiv odds\n- Keep the arXiv submission scholarly: clear abstract, prior work, precise claims, testable implications, and references. Avoid \u201cbook front matter\u201d style; make it look like a research article.\n- If you\u2019re new to arXiv, you may need endorsement in the category. Collaborating with an established arXiv author or requesting an endorsement can help.\n- Be prepared that moderators may reclassify or decline speculative content; a concise, well-structured paper helps.\n\nIf you want, tell me your field and target category, and I can outline the exact steps, metadata to include on Zenodo/OSF, and how to phrase the arXiv \u201cComments\u201d and abstract to cross-link everything cleanly.",

Add your affiliation and ORCID to your profile.\n\n3) Start a new upload and reserve a DOI\n- Click \u201cNew upload.\u201d\n- Resource type: Publication \u2192 Book (or Monograph).\n- Click \u201cReserve DOI.\u201d Copy it for later use (optional: add it to your PDF\u2019s title page and re-upload).\n\n4) Enter metadata carefully\n- Title: exact book title.\n- Authors: add each author with affiliation and ORCID.\n- Description: paste your abstract; add a note like \u201cThis is the authoritative Version 1.0.\u201d\n- Publication date: today\u2019s date (or your chosen date).\n- Keywords: pick 4\u20138 relevant terms (e.g., \u201ctheory of everything,\u201d \u201cunification,\u201d \u201cgeneral relativity,\u201d \u201cquantum foundations\u201d).\n- License: choose your Creative Commons license.\n- Version: \u201cv1.0\u201d (you can later publish v1.1, v2.0, etc.).\n- Communities: optional; only add if clearly relevant.\n- Related/Alternate identifiers: leave blank now; you\u2019ll add your arXiv ID later.\n\n5) Upload the PDF and publish\n- Upload the final PDF. If you reserved a DOI and inserted it into the PDF, make sure this updated file is the one uploaded.\n- Click \u201cPublish.\u201d Zenodo immediately mints a DOI (you also get a concept DOI for the whole record family).\n- Save the DOI URL (e.g., https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx).\n\n6) Future updates\n- If you revise the book, create a \u201cNew version\u201d in Zenodo. You\u2019ll get a new versioned DOI, while the concept DOI stays constant. Cite the specific version DOI in technical work.\n\nPart B \u2014 Post a concise paper on arXiv that points to the book DOI\n7) Choose a primary arXiv category\n- For highly speculative or unification work, physics.gen-ph (General Physics) is the usual home.\n- If your work is mostly GR/cosmology, gr-qc might be relevant; if it\u2019s field-theory heavy, hep-th; if quantum foundations, quant-ph. Moderation is stricter in specialty categories\u2014gen-ph is often safer for broad unification work.\n- You can request cross-listing to secondary categories if appropriate.\n\n8) Create an arXiv account and handle endorsement (if needed)\n- Sign up at arxiv.org and verify your email. Add your ORCID.\n- If you\u2019re new to a category, you may need an endorsement. On the submission page for that category, follow \u201cRequest endorsement.\u201d You can also ask a colleague with recent arXiv submissions in that category to endorse you. Keep the request brief and professional.\n\n9) Write a 10\u201320 page summary paper (aim for a standard research-article format)\n- Structure:\n  - Title and authors (use same as the book; include affiliations, email, ORCID).\n  - Abstract: 150\u2013250 words summarizing the framework, key results, how it compares to prior work, and testable predictions.\n  - Introduction: motivation, prior art, exactly what problem you solve.\n  - Framework/Methods: core equations/logic, minimal necessary details.\n  - Results: derivations, propositions, lemmas as needed; figures if helpful.\n  - Comparison: how this differs from established models; what it reproduces.\n  - Predictions/Tests: concrete, falsifiable implications.\n  - Limitations/Open questions.\n  - References: include mainstream literature; cite your book DOI as a formal reference.\n- Tone: scholarly and precise. Avoid claims like \u201cdisproves all modern physics.\u201d Emphasize specific, checkable results.\n- Length: 10\u201320 pages with 1\u20133 figures is typical and easier to moderate.\n\n10) Prepare the arXiv submission files\n- Use LaTeX if possible. Include:\n  - .tex source, figures (PDF/PNG/JPG), .bib or a .bbl file.\n  - Avoid packages that need shell-escape (e.g., minted). Use listings instead.\n  - Ensure all fonts are embedded; keep PDF size modest (<15\u201320 MB).\n  - Compile cleanly with pdflatex.\n- PDF should not include watermarks, page locks, or password protection.\n\n11) Submit to arXiv\n- Primary category: e.g., physics.gen-ph; request cross-listing if appropriate.\n- Title and authors: match your paper.\n- Abstract: paste the same abstract as in the PDF.\n- Comments field: use it to point to the full book DOI and logistics (pages, figures). Example:\n  - \u201c20 pages, 3 figures. This article summarizes the accompanying 200-page monograph: Your Name (2026), Title of the Book, Zenodo, https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx. The full monograph is also provided as an ancillary file.\u201d\n- Ancillary files: optionally attach the book PDF as an ancillary file (name it clearly, e.g., Book_Monograph_v1.pdf).

Abstract templates (edit to fit; 180\u2013220 words)\n\n1) hep-th oriented (action/symmetry/QFT-based)\n\u201cWe propose a field-theoretic framework for quantum gravity and unification based on [key symmetries/fields], defined by the action [brief description, e.g., gauge-invariant Lagrangian with [group] and [couplings]]. At low energies the theory reduces to the Einstein\u2013Hilbert sector plus Standard-Model\u2013like interactions, while loop corrections match the known effective-field-theory expansion of gravity. We derive [main results: e.g., constraint algebra closure, renormalization properties at [order], anomaly conditions] and show recovery of [benchmark results: e.g., Newtonian limit, standard cosmology] under appropriate limits. The construction differs from [string theory/LQG/HL gravity/EFT] in predicting [distinctive phenomena], including [i] [prediction 1], [ii] [prediction 2], and [iii] [prediction 3], with observational/experimental handles in [context: cosmology, gravitational waves, collider/EFT bounds]. We compare to existing literature on [relevant areas] and delineate parameter regimes consistent with current constraints. Detailed derivations, proofs, and extended discussion are provided in the 200-page monograph [Your Name, Book Title, Zenodo, DOI]. We outline open issues regarding [stability/unitarity/UV completion/phenomenology] and identify near-term tests.\u201d\n\n2) gr-qc oriented (spacetime/semiclassical/black holes/cosmology)\n\u201cWe develop a quantum-gravity framework that modifies the dynamics of spacetime at [scale/regime] while reproducing general relativity in the appropriate limit. Starting from [foundational principle/canonical variables/path-integral ansatz], we obtain [core equations/results: e.g., effective semiclassical field equations, modified constraint algebra, black-hole state counting] and demonstrate consistency with [benchmarks: Bianchi identities, energy conditions in the effective theory, classical tests]. The approach recovers [standard results: Hawking temperature/entropy law/Friedmann equations] and yields testable corrections to [phenomena: early-universe power spectra, gravitational-wave dispersion, black-hole ringdowns]. Relative to [string/LQG/semi-classical EFT], our framework predicts [distinctive signature] governed by [small parameter], constrained by current data at [bound]. We provide analytic derivations and numerical illustrations for representative parameter choices. Full proofs, extended references, and broader context are in the accompanying monograph [Your Name, Book Title, Zenodo, DOI]. We discuss limitations (e.g., [backreaction/renormalization/strong-field regime]) and avenues for further tests.\u201d\n\n3) quantum information/foundations oriented\n\u201cWe present an information-theoretic reconstruction of quantum gravity in which [postulates: causality, locality, operational constraints] imply [mathematical structure], from which spacetime dynamics and gauge interactions emerge. Under minimal assumptions, the reconstruction yields [key theorem/results], recovers quantum field theory in curved spacetime as an effective description, and reproduces general relativity in a thermodynamic/hydrodynamic limit. The framework makes distinct predictions for [entanglement wedges/modular flow/area\u2013entropy relations/quantum inequalities], leading to observable consequences in [cosmology/black-hole thermodynamics/precision quantum experiments]. We compare systematically with related reconstructions and with holographic dualities, clarifying where our assumptions overlap or differ. Detailed axioms, proofs, and applications appear in the monograph [Your Name, Book Title, Zenodo, DOI]. We outline concrete tests and discuss open issues concerning [operational definitions of geometry, state-dependence, semiclassical backreaction].\u201d\n\n4) emergent/thermodynamic gravity oriented\n\u201cWe formulate gravity as an emergent, thermodynamic phenomenon arising from [microstructure: dof/statistical ensemble/information]. From [statistical/entropic] assumptions about microscopic degrees of freedom, we derive [Einstein equations/modified field equations] as an equation of state and identify corrections controlled by [parameter]. The approach reproduces standard tests of GR in weak fields while introducing measurable deviations in [cosmology/galactic dynamics/strong-field] regimes. We analyze consistency with [energy conditions/second law/horizon thermodynamics] and show how [black-hole entropy/Unruh effect] emerge within the framework. Distinct predictions include [prediction 1], [prediction 2], and [prediction 3], which we quantify and confront with current bounds. Full derivations and extended comparisons to [Jacobson/Verlinde/related work] are given in the monograph [Your Name, Book Title, Zenodo, DOI]. We discuss limitations and outline observational strategies.\u201d\n\n5) phenomenology/observables forward\n\u201cWe analyze the observable consequences of a proposed quantum-gravity unification scheme characterized by [key parameters/operators]. Starting from [effective action/modified dispersion/quantum-corrected potentials], we derive signatures in [CMB/large-scale structure/gravitational waves/compact-object spectroscopy/laboratory tests], emphasizing falsifiable predictions distinguishable from [EFT of gravity/LIV/modified gravity]. The framework reduces to GR and the Standard Model in the appropriate limits and remains consistent with current constraints on [PPN parameters, GW propagation speed, equivalence principle tests]. We present parameter forecasts for [current/near-future] experiments and identify ranges where the model is decisively testable. Technical details and the underlying theoretical construction appear in the monograph [Your Name, Book Title, Zenodo, DOI].\u201d\n\nE. First-paragraph-of-introduction templates (pick and adapt)\n\n- hep-th primary:\n\u201cUnifying gravity with quantum mechanics remains a central problem in high-energy theory. Effective-field-theory treatments capture low-energy quantum corrections to general relativity, while candidate UV completions such as string theory and asymptotic-safety scenarios offer distinct mechanisms for consistency at high scales. In this work we develop a complementary field-theoretic framework based on [symmetries/structures], leading to [core result]. We recover known limits\u2014including the Einstein\u2013Hilbert sector and Standard-Model\u2013like interactions\u2014and identify concrete predictions that differentiate our approach from existing proposals. We summarize the construction and its key implications here; complete derivations and extended discussion are provided in [Book Title, DOI].\u201d\n\n- gr-qc primary:\n\u201cQuantum effects in gravity are expected to become relevant in regimes ranging from black-hole horizons to the early universe. Semiclassical analyses and canonical approaches have illuminated aspects of this interface, yet a coherent framework that reproduces GR at low energies while yielding testable departures remains elusive.

In the infrared, the theory reduces to the Einstein\u2013Hilbert sector together with Standard-Model\u2013like interactions, and one-loop corrections reproduce the known effective-field-theory expansion of gravity up to curvature-squared order, with definite relations among Wilson coefficients. We establish closure of the constraint/algebra, show the absence of gauge and mixed gravitational anomalies under [stated representation/condition], and demonstrate unitarity and sensible power counting in a decoupling regime set by a high scale \u039b. The framework recovers the Newtonian, PPN, and FRW limits and is consistent with semiclassical QFT in curved spacetime. It leads to falsifiable predictions, including: (i) corrections to graviton two-point and 2\u21922 scattering with soft behavior modified at O(E^2/\u039b^2); (ii) shifts in black-hole quasinormal-mode spectra, \u0394\u03c9/\u03c9 \u223c \u03b1(M\u039b)^{-p}, with targets for near-future ringdown measurements; and (iii) early-universe signatures such as a controlled deviation in the scalar tilt \u0394ns \u2243 \u03b2(H/\u039b)^q and a characteristic squeezed-limit non-Gaussianity pattern. We map viable parameter space against constraints from LIGO\u2013Virgo\u2013KAGRA, precision PPN tests, and CMB data, and outline near-term discriminating observations. Full derivations, proofs, and extended comparisons appear in the 200-page monograph: [Your Name], [Book Title] (Zenodo), https://doi.org/[DOI]. Open issues include the status of nonperturbative unitarity, potential strong coupling at [scale], and renormalization of higher-dimension operators beyond the orders analyzed here.\n\nIntroduction (first paragraph)\nUnifying gravity with quantum mechanics remains a central objective in high-energy theory. Low-energy quantum corrections to general relativity are well described by the effective-field-theory expansion, while candidate UV completions such as string theory and asymptotic safety pursue consistency at high scales. Here we develop a complementary, explicitly field-theoretic construction based on [state the core symmetry/structure\u2014e.g., an enlarged gauge group with higher-form fields, a constrained geometric sector, or a protected spurion structure], yielding [state the core technical result\u2014e.g., a concrete action with fixed Wilson-coefficient relations, a closed constraint algebra, or an anomaly-cancellation mechanism]. We show that the framework reproduces Einstein gravity and Standard-Model\u2013like interactions in the appropriate limits, matches known EFT coefficients through the orders we compute, and makes concrete, testable predictions in gravitational waves, black-hole perturbations, and early-universe cosmology. This article summarizes the construction, key derivations, and phenomenological implications; the full technical development appears in [Book Title] (Zenodo, https://doi.org/[DOI]).\n\nIntroduction (literature positioning; optional second paragraph)\nOur analysis connects to effective gravity (e.g., Donoghue; Burgess) in reproducing the infrared expansion, to string-inspired unification (e.g., Green\u2013Schwarz\u2013Witten; Polchinski; Maldacena) via [shared structural feature], and to canonical/loop approaches (e.g., Ashtekar; Rovelli; Thiemann) in its treatment of [overlap/contrast]. Unlike these frameworks, our mechanism [state the key difference\u2014e.g., fixes specific Wilson-coefficient ratios, enforces anomaly cancellation through [structure], or yields an emergent metric sector with protected soft limits], leading to distinct observational signatures that we quantify and compare with current bounds.\n\nIf you send me:\n- Your name (as you want it to appear)\n- Book title\n- DOI\n- One-sentence description of your key symmetry/mechanism\n- 2\u20133 specific predictions (even approximate forms or parameter names)\nI\u2019ll produce a fully personalized abstract and intro with no placeholders.",

          "content": "Short answer: write it up like a real paper, package code so others can run it, then submit to arXiv (you may need an endorser). If you might ever patent, talk to a patent attorney before you post anything publicly. Details below.\n\n1) Decide: patent or preprint\n- If you might want a patent: public disclosure can block patents outside the US and starts a 1\u2011year clock in the US. Talk to a patent attorney before posting. Not legal advice.\n- If you just want to establish prior art/priority: arXiv is good and fast. You can also archive code/weights with a DOI the same day to strengthen the timestamp.\n\n2) Minimal but solid package before posting\n- Paper structure\n  - Title and abstract: factual and restrained; avoid hype like \u201crevolutionary.\u201d\n  - Intro: problem, contributions (bullet points).\n  - Related work: cite nearest neighbors and recent baselines.\n  - Method: enough detail to reimplement; diagrams, equations, pseudocode; complexity (params, FLOPs).\n  - Experiments: on standard datasets; fair baselines; report metrics with seeds; learning curves; efficiency (time, memory).\n  - Ablations: key design choices.\n  - Limitations and societal impact.\n  - Reproducibility: hardware (e.g., single 3090), training time, seeds, exact hyperparameters, data preprocessing.\n- Artifacts\n  - GitHub repo with a minimal repro script runnable on a single GPU/Colab; pinned dependencies; config files; seeds; logs.\n  - Pretrained weights for at least one benchmark; Model Card.\n  - License: MIT or Apache\u20112.0 if you want permissive reuse.\n  - Archive a release on Zenodo/OSF to get a DOI and an immutable timestamp; link it in the paper.\n  - Optional: Colab notebook or Hugging Face Space for a quick demo.\n\n3) Getting credible results without a cluster\n- Use widely accepted small/medium benchmarks and compute\u2011fair comparisons: e.g., CIFAR\u201110/100, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-1k at short schedules; MNIST is not convincing.\n- Report accuracy vs compute: parameters, FLOPs, wall\u2011clock on your GPU; plot accuracy vs training time.\n- Run 3\u20135 seeds where feasible; otherwise justify.\n- Compare to strong, efficient baselines tuned under the same budget.\n- Provide ablations and scaling curves to support the mechanism, not just numbers.\n\n4) arXiv submission steps\n- Create an arXiv account and link ORCID (recommended).\n- Endorsement: first\u2011time authors in cs.* usually need endorsement. Use the \u201crequest endorsement\u201d link, ask a colleague, or contact authors you\u2019ve cited; include your draft and why the category fits.\n- Prepare files\n  - LaTeX is preferred; upload source (.tex, bib, figures) as a single .zip/tar. If you only have a PDF, arXiv accepts it, but LaTeX compiles are more robust.\n  - Ensure all figures are embedded and fonts are embedded.\n- Choose categories: typically cs.LG as primary; cross\u2011list to cs.CV/cs.AI/stat.ML as appropriate.\n- Metadata: clear title, concise abstract, comments (e.g., \u201c10 pages, 5 figures\u201d), add your code/DOI links.\n- License: choose CC BY 4.0 or arXiv\u2019s non\u2011exclusive license depending on your preference.\n- Submit before the 14:00 US Eastern deadline to be announced the next business day. Moderation usually takes 0\u20132 days.\n- Your paper gets an arXiv ID and public timestamp when announced. You can upload v2/v3 later with more results.\n\n5) Strengthening the claim the same day\n- Make a GitHub release and archive it on Zenodo (gets a DOI and timestamp).\n- Optionally mirror a short \u201cdefensive publication\u201d summary on OSF or HAL with the same title and link to arXiv/code.\n- Keep a clean commit history and tag the release.\n\n6) Common pitfalls that trigger moderation or hurt credibility\n- Overclaiming without baselines; avoid words like \u201crevolutionary\u201d in the paper.\n- Nonstandard datasets or private test sets without comparison to accepted baselines.\n- Missing references to closely related recent work.\n- No code or inadequate details to reproduce.\n- Violating data licenses or TOS; ensure you have rights to all datasets and pretrained components.\n\n7) After it\u2019s live\n- Share the arXiv link, code repo, and demo. Invite reproduction. Be responsive to issues.\n- If planning to submit to a peer\u2011reviewed venue, check that venue\u2019s arXiv policy (most ML conferences allow preprints).\n- Update the arXiv with stronger experiments as you get more compute; versioning preserves your original timestamp.\n\nQuick checklist\n- Paper: method details, baselines, ablations, compute and seeds, limitations.\n- Code: one\u2011command run, pinned deps, README, license, CITATION.cff.\n- Artifacts: weights, logs, Zenodo DOI, optional demo.\n- arXiv: account, endorsement, categories, license, submit before 14:00 ET.\n- IP: if patent is a possibility, consult counsel before posting.\n\nIf you want, share a brief abstract and the target subfields, and I can suggest a tight title, categories, and a contribution summary that will pass arXiv moderation.",

FrugalNet introduces a lightweight feature\u2011mixing layer that expands receptive fields with minimal FLOPs and memory overhead, paired with a training recipe that stabilizes small\u2011batch optimization. Evaluated on standard image classification benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR\u201110/100 and ImageNet\u20111k under short schedules), FrugalNet matches or exceeds strong mobile backbones under matched training budgets while reducing parameter count and peak memory. We report parameters, FLOPs, and wall\u2011clock time on a single GPU, provide ablations isolating the contributions of the mixing layer and optimization choices, and analyze compute\u2013accuracy trade\u2011offs and scaling trends. Limitations include smaller gains at very high resolutions and in low\u2011data regimes. Code, configs, and pretrained models will be released to facilitate reproduction.\n\nOption B \u2014 Language\n\nTitle\nFrugalLM: A Single\u2011GPU\u2011Friendly Architecture for Efficient Language Modeling\n\nAbstract\nWe present FrugalLM, a compute\u2011efficient architecture for language modeling that delivers strong quality under a single consumer GPU budget. FrugalLM replaces costly dense interactions with a lightweight feature\u2011mixing layer and adopts a training recipe tailored to stabilize optimization at small batch sizes. On standard language modeling benchmarks (e.g., WikiText and curated OpenWebText subsets), FrugalLM attains competitive perplexity under matched training budgets while reducing parameter count and peak memory relative to strong baselines. We report parameters, FLOPs, and wall\u2011clock time, conduct ablations of the mixing layer and training choices, and analyze compute\u2013quality trade\u2011offs and scaling behavior. Limitations include smaller gains on very long\u2011context settings and tasks requiring extensive pretraining data. Code, configs, and pretrained checkpoints will be released to enable reproduction.\n\nIf you share your exact task, mechanism name, and one or two headline results, I can tailor a single, submission\u2011ready title and abstract with your model name and specifics.",

If your domain isn\u2019t vision, tell me and I\u2019ll swap in the right datasets/baselines.\n\nTitle\n[ModelName]: A Compute\u2011Efficient Architecture for Image Classification via [Key Mechanism]\n\nContributions (paste into Intro)\n- We introduce [ModelName], a [brief description, e.g., \u201clightweight vision backbone\u201d] that uses [key mechanism] to [specific benefit, e.g., expand receptive fields/reduce memory/enable sparse mixing] with minimal overhead.\n- Under a single\u2011GPU budget, [ModelName] achieves [top\u20111 = X\u00b1Y% over N seeds] on [CIFAR\u201110/100, Tiny\u2011ImageNet, ImageNet\u20111k (short schedule)], outperforming [baselines: MobileNetV3/V4, ConvNeXt\u2011T, ViT\u2011Ti] by [\u0394] while using [K%] fewer parameters and [K%] lower peak memory.\n- Ablations isolate the contributions of [component A], [component B], and the training recipe; scaling studies show [trend, e.g., monotonic accuracy gains with depth at sublinear FLOP growth].\n- We release code, configs, and pretrained weights to enable one\u2011command reproduction.\n\nAbstract (\u2248180\u2013200 words)\nWe present [ModelName], a compute\u2011efficient architecture for image classification designed to train competitively on a single consumer GPU. [ModelName] introduces [a brief, concrete description of the mechanism; e.g., \u201ca lightweight cross\u2011channel mixing layer that decouples spatial aggregation from channel interaction\u201d], reducing per\u2011layer FLOPs and memory while preserving representational capacity. Under matched training budgets, [ModelName] attains [top\u20111 = X\u00b1Y%] on CIFAR\u201110, [X\u00b1Y%] on CIFAR\u2011100, and [X%] on ImageNet\u20111k with a short schedule, exceeding [MobileNetV3/V4, ConvNeXt\u2011T, ViT\u2011Ti] by up to [\u0394] at [K%] fewer parameters and [K%] lower peak memory. We report parameters, FLOPs, throughput, and wall\u2011clock on a single [GPU model], and provide ablations of [mechanism components] and training choices (optimizer, normalization, data augmentation). Accuracy\u2013compute curves and scaling studies indicate [key finding; e.g., stable optimization at small batch sizes and favorable accuracy per FLOP]. Limitations include [e.g., smaller gains at very high resolutions or on fine\u2011grained datasets]. Code, configs, and pretrained checkpoints are available at [GitHub URL]; we archive a snapshot with DOI at [Zenodo/OSF DOI].\n\nSection openers and checklists\n\n1) Introduction (starter text)\nTraining competitive vision models often assumes large compute budgets. We address this gap with [ModelName], which targets strong accuracy under a single\u2011GPU budget by [one\u2011line mechanism]. In compute\u2011matched comparisons on standard benchmarks, [ModelName] improves accuracy and efficiency relative to strong mobile and tiny backbones.\n\n2) Related Work (organize into 3 short subsections)\n- Vision backbones: ConvNets (ResNet/ConvNeXt), Transformers (DeiT/ViT), MLP\u2011Mixers; how you differ.\n- Efficiency: depthwise separable, group conv, low\u2011rank/sparse mixing, dynamic routing; where your mechanism fits.\n- Training on limited compute: small\u2011batch stabilization, sharpness\u2011aware optimization, EMA, augmentation policies.\n\n3) Method\n- Architecture overview: stage/block layout; tensor shapes through one block.\n- Key mechanism: define [mechanism] precisely (equations/pseudocode); note where it replaces standard ops.\n- Complexity: params/FLOPs per block and total; training vs inference memory; latency considerations.\n- Implementation: initialization, normalization choice, activations, residual/skip connections.\n\n4) Experimental Setup\n- Datasets: CIFAR\u201110/100, Tiny\u2011ImageNet (64\u00d764), and ImageNet\u20111k short schedule (e.g., 100\u2013150 epochs).\n- Metrics: top\u20111/top\u20115, throughput (img/s), latency, peak memory, wall\u2011clock.\n- Baselines (compute\u2011matched and tuned): MobileNetV3/V4, ConvNeXt\u2011T/S, ViT\u2011Ti/S, MLP\u2011Mixer\u2011S.\n- Training: optimizer (AdamW/SGD), LR schedule (cosine/warmup), batch size/grad accumulation, precision (fp16/bf16), augmentations (RandAug, MixUp/CutMix), weight decay, EMA (optional).\n- Hardware/reporting: single [GPU model], hours/epoch, total GPU hours; N seeds.\n\n5) Results\n- Main table: accuracy vs baselines (mean\u00b1std); bold best per compute bracket.\n- Efficiency table: params, FLOPs, throughput, memory, latency.\n- Plots: accuracy vs FLOPs; accuracy vs wall\u2011clock.\n- Short analysis: where gains concentrate (e.g., small\u2011data or low\u2011resolution).\n\n6) Ablations\n- Remove/replace [mechanism] \u2192 \u0394 accuracy/compute.\n- Vary depth/width/sparsity of [mechanism] \u2192 scaling trend.\n- Training recipe sensitivity: batch size, LR, norm type, augmentation on/off.\n- Failure modes: datasets/settings where gains vanish.\n\n7) Analysis/Qualitative (optional)\n- Feature spectra/attention maps; calibration; robustness to corruptions (CIFAR\u2011C/ImageNet\u2011C short).\n\n8) Limitations\n- E.g., diminished gains at >384 px, or latency on CPU/mobile not yet optimized.\n\n9) Societal Impact/Ethics\n- Data licenses/provenance; potential misuse; bias notes.\n\n10) Conclusion\n- Recap mechanism and evidence; note next steps (e.g., detection/segmentation transfer, long\u2011context).\n\nBaselines and budgets (single\u2011GPU friendly)\n- Train tiny/small variants to convergence on CIFAR/Tiny\u2011IN; for ImageNet\u20111k, use short schedules with matched epochs and augmentations across methods.\n- Report: params, FLOPs (ptflops/thop), peak memory (torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated), throughput (img/s), latency (bs=1), and wall\u2011clock per epoch.\n\nArtifacts checklist\n- One\u2011command run (train/eval), pinned deps, exact configs.\n- Pretrained weights + logs; Model Card; license.\n- Zenodo/OSF archive DOI; link in abstract.\n\narXiv categories\n- Primary: cs.LG; Cross\u2011list: cs.CV, stat.ML (optional).\n\nIf your work is not image classification, reply with:\n- Domain/task\n- Mechanism (1\u20132 sentences)\n- Headline numbers and datasets\n- GPU model and training time\n- Baselines you beat\n\nI\u2019ll swap in the right datasets, metrics, and baselines and deliver a final, paper\u2011ready outline with your numbers filled in.",

Use LaTeX and include references, math, and testable claims.\n- Zenodo or Figshare: Upload a PDF and get a DOI immediately; you can also archive code/data.

Alternatively, a driven qubit with Rabi pulses and Ramsey interference.\n- Narrative: If we prepare |\u2191z\u27e9, rotate by \u03b8, and measure along \u03c6 after interaction time t, the standard prediction is [qualitative: cos\u00b2(\u03b8\u2212\u03c6) statistics].

Treat this as a model template you can edit\u2014swap in your own idea where you see fit.\n\nExample abstract (5 sentences)\nI propose a bounded-information state-update principle for qubits: during any finite-strength, finite-time measurement interaction, the amount of information extracted\u2014and thus the disturbance\u2014is capped by a context-dependent bound \u03b5. Unlike the standard L\u00fcders/quantum-trajectory update, which lets disturbance grow smoothly with coupling g and interaction time t, the bounded rule yields a threshold-like or saturating response in sequential, partially measured qubits. This produces specific, testable deviations in two-step spin measurements and Ramsey interferometry: a residual visibility plateau and mild phase offset for weak probes that standard quantum mechanics predicts should already reduce contrast. The model reduces to standard predictions in the limits g\u21920, t\u21920, or \u03b5\u2192\u221e, and respects no-signalling and probability conservation. I outline feasible tests with superconducting circuits or trapped ions and specify falsifiable signatures in visibility-vs-strength curves and harmonic content of Ramsey fringes.\n\nSection 3. Core idea (qualitative)\n- Claim. The state update caused by a finite measurement coupling is limited by a bounded-information principle: up to a bound \u03b5, additional weak interaction does not further reduce coherence, and only once the cumulative extracted information exceeds \u03b5 does disturbance grow. This modifies how partial measurements compose in time, while leaving strong, projective measurements indistinguishable from standard theory to within experimental resolution.\n- Assumptions\n  1) Probability is conserved; outcome statistics are well-defined for any measurement basis.\n  2) No-signalling: local marginals in composite systems are independent of spacelike-separated settings.\n  3) Symmetry: in the absence of apparatus anisotropy, predictions depend only on relative angles between preparation and measurement axes.\n  4) Continuity: as \u03b5\u21920 or coupling\u21920, predictions match standard quantum mechanics.\n- Intuitive mechanism (spin-1/2 narrative)\n  - Preparation: A spin-1/2 is prepared along angle \u03b8 on the Bloch sphere.\n  - Weak interaction: It couples to an apparatus aligned near z with strength g for time t, extracting partial which-axis information.\n  - Update rule: If the cumulative information I(g, t) < \u03b5, the Bloch vector\u2019s transverse component is largely retained; for I \u2265 \u03b5, the transverse component contracts as in the standard update. Sequential weak interactions add sublinearly below \u03b5, producing a \u201cdeadband\u201d where disturbance is minimal.\n  - Outcome: In a subsequent measurement along axis \u03c6, outcome frequencies follow the usual cos\u00b2((\u03b8\u2212\u03c6)/2) law except that contrast V is piecewise: V \u2248 V0 for I < \u03b5 and then declines with I beyond \u03b5. A small, basis-aligned bias can create a detectable phase offset in fringes.\n\nSection 4. Minimal model (no equations yet)\n- System and variables\n  - Qubit state with preparation angle \u03b8; measurement axis \u03c6.\n  - Interaction: coupling strength g, duration t; define an effective information-extraction measure I(g, t).\n  - Environment/technical decoherence rate \u03b3 (independent of the new effect).\n  - New parameter: \u03b5 (dimensionless bound on extractable information before additional disturbance appears).\n- Invariances/constraints\n  - Rotational invariance about the apparatus axis; conservation of total probability; no superluminal signalling.\n  - Recovery: as \u03b5\u21920, regain standard smooth disturbance; as \u03b5\u2192\u221e or g\u21920 or t\u21920, regain undisturbed evolution.\n- Limiting cases\n  - Weak limit: I \u2192 0 with fixed \u03b3 gives standard high-visibility Ramsey/Stern\u2013Gerlach statistics.\n  - Strong limit: I \u2192 \u221e reproduces projective-measurement outcomes and standard state collapse.\n  - Sequential composition: two weak interactions with I1 + I2 < \u03b5 behave approximately like a single weaker interaction (subadditivity below the bound).\n- Scaling expectations\n  - Visibility V( I ) \u2248 V0 for I < \u03b5, then decreases monotonically for I > \u03b5.\n  - A small, apparatus-aligned phase offset \u03b4\u03c6 may scale like min(I/\u03b5, 1) times a calibration factor set by alignment errors.\n\nSection 5. Illustrative scenario (Ramsey sequence with a weak probe)\n- Setup\n  - Use a two-level atom, trapped ion, or superconducting qubit.\n  - Perform a Ramsey sequence: \u03c0/2 pulse (prepares \u03b8), free evolution, weak dispersive probe aligned with \u03c3z for time t at strength g, then a second \u03c0/2 pulse with adjustable phase \u03c6, followed by projective readout.\n- Standard prediction (qualitative)\n  - Output population oscillates sinusoidally with \u03c6; fringe visibility decreases smoothly with probe strength due to measurement-induced dephasing; no phase offset beyond known systematic shifts.\n- Predicted deviation (this model)\n  - For probe settings with I(g, t) < \u03b5, the fringe visibility remains near the unprobed value V0, contrary to the smooth decay expected from standard dephasing.\n  - As I crosses \u03b5, visibility exhibits a kink or threshold-like drop; small non-sinusoidal distortion or a fixed offset \u03b4\u03c6 may appear if the apparatus defines a preferred axis.\n  - If two weak probes are inserted back-to-back, the second has little additional effect while I1 + I2 < \u03b5, revealing subadditivity; once I1 + I2 \u2265 \u03b5, visibility reduction resumes.\n- Where to look\n  - Scan probe strength (e.g., readout photon number or interaction time) across the lowest decade where standard theory predicts a 5\u201320% visibility loss; the model predicts a plateau in exactly that region.\n  - Repeat with the order of operations reversed (probe placement before/after the first \u03c0/2) to test for history dependence.\n\nSection 6. Empirical consequences and tests\n- Measurables\n  - Fringe visibility V versus probe strength g and duration t.\n  - Phase offset \u03b4\u03c6 versus alignment; Fourier spectrum of counts versus \u03c6 (to detect non-sinusoidal components).\n  - Differential effects under protocol variations: single weak probe vs two weaker probes whose strengths sum to the same I.\n- Specific signatures that differ from standard QM\n  1) Visibility plateau: V \u2248 V0 for I < \u03b5, producing a clear kink compared to an exponential or Gaussian decay.\n  2) Subadditivity below threshold: two half-strength probes cause less total visibility loss than one full-strength probe with I equal to their sum.\n  3) Small, apparatus-axis phase offset \u03b4\u03c6 that remains constant across the plateau and changes only when I exceeds \u03b5.\n- Practical feasibility\n  - Superconducting qubits: dispersive readout allows continuous tuning of measurement strength via readout power and time; typical T2 ~ 10\u2013100 \u00b5s; probe windows of 50\u2013500 ns.\n  - Trapped ions: state-dependent fluorescence or phase-shift probes with coherence times > 1 ms enable clean Ramsey scans; probe strength tuned by detuning/intensity.\n  - Required stability: fringe contrast reproducibility at the percent level; calibration of intrinsic dephasing \u03b3 so the plateau is not a calibration artifact.\n- Falsification criteria\n  - If V(g, t) follows a smooth, single-parameter decay with no kink/plateau across the region where the model predicts I < \u03b5, the bounded-update hypothesis is ruled out at the corresponding confidence.\n  - If two half-strength probes reduce visibility identically to one full-strength probe with the same total I, subadditivity is falsified.\n  - Absence of any systematic \u03b4\u03c6 within experimental resolution, after controlling systematics, disfavors apparatus-axis bias predictions.\n\nOptional short title you could use\n- Bounded-Information State Updates for Qubits: A Threshold Test with Ramsey Interferometry\n\nConcise references to cite (swap for ones matching your platform)\n- Wiseman and Milburn, Quantum Measurement and Control (Cambridge, 2010).\n- Jacobs, Quantum Measurement Theory and its Applications (Cambridge, 2014).\n- Korotkov, Quantum Bayesian approach to circuit QED measurement, arXiv:1111.4016.\n- Hatridge et al., Quantum back-action of an individual variable-strength measurement, Science 339, 178 (2013).\n- Murch et al., Observing quantum trajectories of a superconducting qubit, Nature 502, 211 (2013).\n- Myatt et al., Decoherence of quantum superpositions through coupling to engineered reservoirs, Nature 403, 269 (2000).\n- Schlosshauer, Decoherence and the Quantum-to-Classical Transition (Springer, 2007/2019).\n\nIf you like this structure but want it tuned to your actual idea, share your 3\u20135 sentence abstract and whether you prefer the Stern\u2013Gerlach or Ramsey version, and I\u2019ll rewrite sections 3\u20136 to match.",

Treat this as a template you can adapt to your own concept.\n\nExample abstract (5 sentences)\nI propose a context-dependent recombination rule for single-photon interference: when partial which-path tagging of strength m is present, the interference pattern at the second beamsplitter acquires a small, intrinsic second-harmonic component in \u03c6 (cos 2\u03c6) in addition to the usual sinusoidal fringe, while conserving total probability and respecting no-signalling. Standard quantum mechanics predicts purely sinusoidal single-photon fringes with visibility set solely by coherence; under my proposal, the visibility-versus-tagging curve can include a gentle plateau and a phase-dependent distortion that are largest at intermediate distinguishability. The rule recovers standard results in the limits m\u21920 (no tagging) and m\u21921 (full which-path information, no interference). I outline tabletop tests with a Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer using weak polarization tagging or dispersive phase kicks. Falsifiable signatures include nonzero second-harmonic power in a Fourier analysis of counts vs phase, a slight port asymmetry tied to m, and a kink in the visibility curve.\n\nSection 3. Core idea (qualitative)\n- Claim. Interference recombination is mildly context-dependent: the relative phase \u03c6 and residual path distinguishability m interact through a constrained rule that adds a small cos 2\u03c6 component to the output probabilities when 0 < m < 1. Strong and zero-tagging limits behave as in standard theory; the deviation is confined to intermediate m.\n- Assumptions\n  1) Probability is conserved at each beamsplitter; outcomes remain between 0 and 1.\n  2) No-signalling: in any entangled extension, local marginals do not depend on spacelike-separated settings.\n  3) Symmetry: for a perfectly symmetric interferometer, predictions are invariant under exchanging the two paths and depend only on \u03c6 and m.\n  4) Recovery: as m\u21920 or m\u21921, predictions reduce to the standard sinusoid or flat counts, respectively.\n- Intuitive mechanism\n  - Path tagging couples each arm weakly to a marker (e.g., polarization rotation or frequency shift), extracting partial which-path information quantified by m.\n  - At recombination, the marker\u2019s partial distinguishability slightly \u201cwarps\u201d how phase information converts to output probabilities, introducing a bounded second-harmonic response without altering the average count rate over a full 2\u03c0 phase scan.\n  - The effect is small, largest for intermediate m, and disappears if either path information is zero or complete.\n\nSection 4. Minimal model (no equations yet)\n- Variables and parameters\n  - \u03c6: phase difference between the two arms.\n  - m \u2208 [0,1]: path-marking strength (0=no marking, 1=full which-path info).\n  - g, t: coupling strength and interaction time controlling m in a given apparatus.\n  - V0: baseline visibility without tagging (set by technical coherence).\n  - \u03b1(m): amplitude of the induced second harmonic (new, dimensionless; \u03b1(0)=\u03b1(1)=0).\n- Constraints and limits\n  - Probability conservation at each port and overall normalization.\n  - Symmetry: with balanced beamsplitters and identical losses, exchanging ports flips \u03c6\u2192\u03c6+\u03c0.\n  - Limits: m\u21920 yields sinusoidal fringes with visibility V0; m\u21921 yields flat 1/2 counts independent of \u03c6; \u03b1(m) peaks at intermediate m and is bounded by a small constant set by apparatus symmetry.\n- Scaling expectations\n  - Visibility V(m) decreases with m but can show a shallow plateau near the onset of tagging.\n  - Second-harmonic power scales like \u03b1(m)^2, with \u03b1 roughly proportional to m for small m, then saturating or turning over before m\u21921.\n  - Any port asymmetry at fixed \u03c6 averages to zero over \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], preserving total energy balance.\n\nSection 5. Illustrative scenario (Mach\u2013Zehnder with weak path tagging)\n- Setup\n  - Single-photon MZI with phase shifter in one arm and identical 50:50 beamsplitters.\n  - Weak which-path tagger: a small polarization rotation in one arm, or a tunable dispersive interaction producing a slight, controllable distinguishability m.\n  - Detectors at both output ports with single-photon resolution; optional polarization analyzers to vary m.\n- Standard prediction (qualitative)\n  - Output count rates at each port vary sinusoidally with \u03c6: I\u00b1 = 1/2[1 \u00b1 V(m) cos \u03c6], with V(m) set solely by coherence/marking; no harmonic content beyond the fundamental.\n- Predicted deviation (this model)\n  - Counts exhibit a small cos 2\u03c6 component whose amplitude depends on m, producing a slight distortion of the sinusoid and a gentle visibility plateau as m increases from zero.\n  - A tiny, m-linked port asymmetry may appear at specific \u03c6 but integrates to zero over a full scan.\n  - The effect is stable under scan direction (no hysteresis) and tied specifically to the tagging strength, not to phase sweep rate.\n- Where to look\n  - Intermediate tagging 0.2 \u2272 m \u2272 0.6, where standard visibility would be 40\u201380% and the second harmonic is maximal.\n  - Fourier analysis of counts vs \u03c6: look for a statistically significant peak at 2\u03c6 above systematics.\n\nSection 6. Empirical consequences and tests\n- Measurables\n  - Fringe visibility V(m) vs tagging strength.\n  - Fourier spectrum of counts vs \u03c6 (amplitudes at 1\u00d7 and 2\u00d7 the phase).\n  - Port-to-port asymmetry at fixed \u03c6 and its dependence on m.\n- Specific signatures that differ from standard QM\n  1) Nonzero second-harmonic amplitude at 2\u03c6 that scales reproducibly with m and vanishes at m\u21920 and m\u21921.\n  2) A shallow visibility plateau or kink vs m, inconsistent with a single smooth decay law derived from standard decoherence.\n  3) Invariance under scan direction and scan speed, distinguishing the effect from thermal or servo lag artifacts.\n- Practical feasibility\n  - Tabletop optics with heralded single photons or attenuated coherent states; polarization rotators or electro-optic modulators to set m; phase stability at the milliradian level.\n  - Use reference scans with m=0 and m near 1 to calibrate and bound systematics; subtract detector nonlinearity using low count rates and linearity checks.\n- Falsification criteria\n  - If counts vs \u03c6 are well fit by a single sinusoid across all m (and \u03b1 is bounded below experimental noise), the context-dependent recombination rule is excluded.\n  - If V(m) follows a standard complementarity-consistent decay with no plateau or kink within error bars, the model is disfavored.\n  - Any observed second harmonic that tracks known technical systematics (e.g., beamsplitter imbalance varying with \u03c6) does not support the model.\n\nOptional short title\n- Context-Dependent Recombination in Single-Photon Interference: A Test via Second-Harmonic Fringes\n\nConcise references to cite\n- B.-G.

Do not submit outputs externally.\n- The LaTeX template contains a watermark and hyperref metadata noting synthetic content.\n- Content generation here is a stub; integrate your LLM in scripts/gen_content.py if needed, and cache responses for reproducibility.\n- Avoid adding packages that require shell-escape.\n\nMakefile targets\n- make gen: generate N JSON manuscripts (default 10; override with N=50).\n- make build: parallel build of all manuscripts in data/manuscripts/.\n- make clean: remove build artifacts and manifest.\n\n=== Makefile ===\nMANUS := $(wildcard data/manuscripts/*.json)\nN ?= 10\n\n.PHONY: gen build clean\n\ngen:\n\tpython3 scripts/gen_content.py --n $(N)\n\nbuild:\n\tpython3 scripts/parallel_build.py\n\nclean:\n\trm -rf build manifest.csv\n\n=== requirements.txt ===\njinja2==3.1.4\nnumpy==1.26.4\nmatplotlib==3.8.4\ntqdm==4.66.4\n\n=== docker/Dockerfile ===\nFROM debian:stable-slim\n\nENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \\\n    make git python3 python3-pip ca-certificates \\\n    texlive-full latexmk chktex aspell aspell-en poppler-utils \\\n && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\nWORKDIR /work\nCOPY requirements.txt .\nRUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n\nCMD [\"bash\"]\n\n=== templates/paper.tex.j2 ===\n\\documentclass[11pt]{article}\n\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}\n\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n\\usepackage{lmodern}\n\\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}\n\\usepackage{graphicx}\n\\usepackage{natbib}\n\\usepackage{xcolor}\n\\usepackage{hyperref}\n\\hypersetup{\n  colorlinks=true,\n  linkcolor=blue,\n  citecolor=blue,\n  urlcolor=blue,\n  pdftitle={{{ title }}},\n  pdfauthor={{{ authors|map(attribute='name')|join(', ') }}},\n  pdfsubject={Synthetic manuscript for internal testing},\n}\n\\usepackage{draftwatermark}\n\\SetWatermarkText{Synthetic -- Internal Use}\n\\SetWatermarkScale{0.18}\n\\SetWatermarkColor[gray]{0.9}\n\n\\title{{{{ title }}}}\n\\author{{% for a in authors %}{{ a.name }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}}\n\\date{\\today}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\maketitle\n\n\\begin{abstract}\n{{ abstract }}\n\nThis document is synthetic and generated for internal testing only.

I can give you an arXiv-ready LaTeX template, a packaging checklist, and the fastest way to get a public timestamp if arXiv moderation/endorsement slows you down.\n\nImportant realities before we start\n- arXiv requires a subject-area endorsement for first-time submitters and moderates all submissions. You typically won\u2019t appear \u201cimmediately.\u201d Best case: same-day submission, next-day announcement; but endorsement/moderation can delay or reject.\n- To establish priority right now, also upload the PDF and source to a DOI-granting preprint host (e.g., Zenodo or OSF Preprints) and/or a public GitHub repo. You can do this today while you prepare the arXiv submission.\n\nMinimal, arXiv-friendly LaTeX template (pdflatex, no shell-escape, no exotic fonts)\nCopy this into main.tex and replace placeholders.

Clear writing, standard terminology, and proper citations help.\n\nImmediate timestamp alternatives (do this today)\n- Zenodo.org:\n  - Create a record, upload PDF + source .zip, get a DOI instantly. Choose \u201cPreprint\u201d type, CC BY.\n- OSF Preprints:\n  - Upload PDF + source; instant timestamp and DOI via Crossref.\n- GitHub + Zenodo:\n  - Public repo with source + PDF; connect to Zenodo to mint a DOI for the repo release.\n- Then proceed with arXiv; include the DOI in your arXiv comments/metadata.\n\nQuality/tone checklist to pass moderation\n- Use standard definitions and cite foundational results (Cook\u2013Levin, Karp reductions, PCP, barriers like relativization/natural proofs/algebrization if relevant).\n- State main theorem(s) precisely; avoid grandiose language in the abstract/body.\n- Include a proof roadmap, lemmas with clear dependencies, and a running-time analysis tied to a standard model.\n- Include related work and how your approach avoids known barriers if you claim to resolve P vs NP.\n\nIf you want, paste your current preamble/package list or a minimal example that fails to compile, and I\u2019ll tailor it to be arXiv-safe.

While you prepare that, here\u2019s a compact template plus a checklist so you can self-check before sending.\n\nAbstract template (neutral, specific, arXiv-friendly)\n- One-sentence context: why the problem matters.\n- Main technical claim in precise terms (name the problem, model, and time bound).\n- Two\u2013three sentences on the core idea/technique at a high level.\n- Key lemmas or structural properties you prove.\n- Consequences/corollaries (state only those you actually prove).\n- Scope/limitations if any (e.g., handles 3-SAT; worst-case; deterministic; uniform).\n- Tone: avoid hype; use \u201cwe give/show/prove\u201d not \u201cwe finally resolve.\u201d\n\nExample abstract scaffold\nWe give a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for 3-SAT. Given a 3-CNF formula F with n variables and m clauses (input size N = \u0398(n + m) under a standard encoding), our algorithm decides satisfiability in time O(N^c) on a standard multitape Turing machine (equivalently, on a word-RAM with word size \u0398(log N)). The algorithm is based on [brief idea: e.g., a decomposition of the implication graph into X, combined with a dynamic programming scheme over Y]. The proof establishes [state your central lemma(s) succinctly], which implies correctness and the stated running time. As an immediate corollary, SAT \u2208 P and hence P = NP by the Cook\u2013Levin theorem and standard Karp reductions. Our techniques are [nonrelativizing/non-naturalizing/etc. if applicable], and do not rely on randomization or nonuniformity.\n\nMain theorem statement template (be fully precise)\n- Define the input and its size.\n- State the machine model.\n- Give an explicit bound and quantify constants.\n- Make correctness and runtime claims separately if clearer.\n\nExample theorem and corollary\nTheorem 1 (Main). There exists a deterministic algorithm A and a constant c \u2265 1 such that, for every 3-CNF formula F on n variables and m clauses (encoded in the standard way with size N = \u0398(n + m)), A decides whether F is satisfiable in at most O(N^c) steps on a deterministic multitape Turing machine. The algorithm A is uniform and explicit.\n\nCorollary 2. SAT \u2208 P. Consequently, P = NP.\n\nOptional refinements (pick what applies)\n- If you have a concrete exponent: replace O(N^c) with N^7 (or whatever).\n- If you analyze more precisely in terms of literals L: use N = \u0398(n + L) and state O(N^c).\n- If you work on SAT (not just 3-SAT): state SAT directly and note 3-SAT reduction if needed.\n- If you use the RAM model: \u201cword-RAM with word size w = \u0398(log N) and unit-cost arithmetic on w-bit words.\u201d\n\nChecklist for the abstract and theorem\n- Problem: Name the exact decision problem (3-SAT or SAT).\n- Inputs: Define n, m, and N (encoding size). Avoid mixing n and N.\n- Model: Deterministic multitape TM or word-RAM with w = \u0398(log N).\n- Uniformity: No preprocessing depending on N outside the stated time.\n- Determinism: No randomness; if there is, specify derandomization or success prob.\n- Bound: Explicit polynomial; constants independent of the input instance.\n- Reductions: Cite Cook\u2013Levin and Karp for NP-completeness and corollary.\n- No promises: State that it\u2019s worst-case, not promise/average-case.\n- No hidden oracles: Avoid language suggesting advice/nonuniformity.\n- Tone: Neutral; no \u201cfinally/first time in history.\u201d\n\nCommon wording pitfalls to avoid\n- \u201cOur algorithm runs in polynomial time for typical instances.\u201d (Not a worst-case claim.)\n- \u201cWe show P = NP by arguing SAT is easy.\u201d (Say you give a deterministic poly-time algorithm for SAT.)\n- \u201cWe assume inputs are in general position\u201d (That\u2019s a promise problem; either prove it for all inputs or state the promise clearly.)\n- \u201cPolynomial time on a RAM with unit-cost arithmetic on unbounded integers.\u201d (Clarify word size \u0398(log N) or bound integer growth.)\n\nIf you paste your draft abstract and theorem here, I\u2019ll edit them into final arXiv-ready wording.",

That means LaTeX, standard structure, measured claims, engagement with the literature, and clean, reproducible details. Below is a practical checklist plus an arXiv-specific guide.\n\nWhat \u201cprofessional\u201d looks like\n- Use LaTeX and AMS packages; avoid unusual styling. Submit source, not just a PDF.\n- Structure like mainstream math/physics papers and write in a neutral, precise tone.\n- State exact assumptions and theorems, give complete proofs, and show how your results relate to known work.\n- Keep claims proportionate and testable; avoid rhetoric.\n\nWriting/formatting checklist\n1) Preamble and typography\n- Use article or amsart with amsmath, amsthm, amssymb, mathtools, hyperref, cleveref, graphicx, microtype.\n- Define theorem environments. Keep fonts, spacing, and notation conventional. No watermarks or colored backgrounds.\n- Keep line length reasonable; avoid tiny margins and large interline spacing.\n\n2) Paper structure\n- Title: concise and specific; no sensational wording.\n- Author/affiliation: your name; \u201cIndependent researcher\u201d is acceptable. Include ORCID and email.\n- Abstract: 1 paragraph, 100\u2013200 words; what you prove and why it matters; no hype.\n- Keywords and classification: MSC for math or appropriate physics subject tags if you use them.\n- Introduction:\n  \u2022 Context: What problem are you addressing? Prior approaches (cite them).\n  \u2022 Contributions: bullet list of your main theorems/results.\n  \u2022 Roadmap: outline of sections.\n- Preliminaries/notation: define objects, assumptions, and conventions you use.\n- Main results: state theorems precisely; give intuition and proof sketches before full proofs if helpful.\n- Proofs: complete, numbered lemmas/propositions, cross-referenced equations, no gaps.\n- Examples/consistency checks: special cases that recover known results; limiting behavior; units/dimensions; sanity checks against experiments if relevant.\n- Discussion/related work: how your result fits or conflicts with standard theories; what must be wrong in existing assumptions if your results hold.\n- Limitations and falsifiable predictions (if you claim physical implications).\n- Appendices for lengthy technicalities.\n- Acknowledgments and funding (if any).\n\n3) Citations and bibliography\n- Cite primary literature (journals and relevant arXiv papers), not just textbooks or blogs.\n- Use BibTeX; include DOIs/arXiv IDs. On arXiv, include the generated .bbl file and your .bib file or compile locally to ensure references render.\n- Show awareness of the most closely related modern papers (last 5\u201310 years).\n\n4) Style and tone\n- Replace \u201cproves physics is wrong\u201d with precise, bounded claims: \u201cUnder assumptions A\u2013C, we show a contradiction with D,\u201d or \u201cWe derive E, which differs from standard prediction F by G; here are conditions and a proposed test.\u201d\n- Avoid informal language, rhetorical questions, and exclamation points.\n- Define every symbol on first use; maintain consistent notation throughout.\n\n5) Technical polish\n- Spellcheck and grammar check; ask a fluent writer to copyedit.\n- Figures: vector PDF/EPS; clear labels; consistent axes and units.\n- Cross-references: use \\label/\\ref or cleveref; no \u201csee above\u201d or hardcoded numbers.\n- Build warnings: resolve LaTeX warnings, undefined refs, overfull boxes.\n- Length: most single-result papers are 10\u201325 pages; keep it as short as clarity allows.\n\narXiv specifics\n- Endorsement: Some categories require an endorser. Strategies:\n  \u2022 Identify 2\u20133 researchers who have recently posted in your exact subcategory; send a very short, polite email with a 1\u20132 page summary and ask if they\u2019d consider endorsing if it seems appropriate. Do not argue or spam; accept silence as a no.\n  \u2022 Alternatively, attend local seminars/online reading groups and ask organizers after a brief discussion.\n- Choosing a category:\n  \u2022 Pick the narrowest accurate category (e.g., math.MP, gr-qc, hep-th, quant-ph). \u201cphysics.gen-ph\u201d is heavily moderated and often a dead end if the work is primarily mathematical.\n  \u2022 If it\u2019s mathematical foundations of a physical theory, math.MP or math-ph can be better than a general physics category.\n- Submission package:\n  \u2022 Submit source: .tex files, .bbl, figures. Avoid shell-escape-dependent packages (minted, sagetex); listings is safer.\n  \u2022 Test compile with pdflatex (or lualatex/xelatex if you know arXiv supports your setup) using a standard TeX Live; ensure it compiles without internet access.\n  \u2022 No external fonts that require installation; embed all figures.\n  \u2022 Provide a concise abstract and choose a license (CC BY is common).\n- Comments field: You can add a brief note like \u201c20 pages, 3 figures; comments welcome.\u201d Don\u2019t use it to argue with moderators.\n\nSubstance matters most (especially for outsider submissions)\n- Engage directly with standard formalisms: state exactly which postulate, equation, or theorem you modify or contradict.\n- Recover standard results in limits where your assumptions match theirs.\n- If you predict deviations, quantify them and propose concrete tests or computations that others can replicate.\n- Include a short companion note or appendix that walks a typical expert from the standard framework to your result in a few steps.\n\nGetting pre-submission feedback\n- Ask for targeted, answerable questions on MathOverflow or Physics Stack Exchange (not \u201cplease review my paper,\u201d but \u201cIs Lemma 2 valid under assumption X?\u201d).\n- Share a 1\u20132 page \u201cexecutive summary\u201d with a colleague, local seminar organizer, or a researcher you cite; make it easy for them to assess.\n\nMinimal LaTeX skeleton (non-fancy, arXiv-friendly)\n- Use this as a starting point; keep packages conservative.\n\n\\documentclass[11pt]{article}\n\\usepackage{amsmath,amsthm,amssymb,mathtools}\n\\usepackage{graphicx}\n\\usepackage[unicode]{hyperref}\n\\usepackage[nameinlink]{cleveref}\n\\usepackage{microtype}\n\n\\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}\n\\newtheorem{lemma}[theorem]{Lemma}\n\\theoremstyle{definition}\n\\newtheorem{definition}[theorem]{Definition}\n\\theoremstyle{remark}\n\\newtheorem{remark}[theorem]{Remark}\n\n\\title{Concise, specific title about X under assumptions Y}\n\\author{Your Name\\\\Independent researcher\\\\\\texttt{youremail@example.com}}\n\\date{\\today}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\maketitle\n\n\\begin{abstract}\nWe show that [main result] under assumptions [A,B,C].

Replace bracketed text with your specifics; keep the tone measured and the claims bounded.\n\nIntroduction (template text)\n- Paragraph 1: Context and motivation\n[Area X] provides the prevailing framework for [phenomenon/domain], under assumptions such as [A, B, C]. This framework has achieved [canonical successes], including [examples with refs: Ref1, Ref2]. At the same time, several tensions remain in regimes where [conditions], as suggested by [observations/theorems/heuristics; Ref3, Ref4]. These tensions motivate a closer examination of [specific assumption/mechanism] and the mathematical structures that underlie it.\n\n- Paragraph 2: Gap this paper addresses\nIn this work we identify a precise limitation of the standard framework: under assumptions [A\u2013C], it implies [Statement S]. We show that [S] conflicts with [Theorem/Conservation law/Empirical regularity D] in the regime [R], or requires an additional constraint [E] that is not generally satisfied. This indicates that at least one of [assumptions A\u2013C] must be relaxed or reformulated. We develop an alternative formulation that preserves [key desiderata] while avoiding [the identified inconsistency], and we establish its consequences rigorously.\n\n- Paragraph 3: Main contributions (succinct bullets)\nOur contributions are as follows:\n1) Main theorem/result. We prove Theorem 1: [precise high-level statement], under assumptions [A\u2013C].\n2) Mechanism/derivation. We introduce [new construction/variational principle/representation] that yields [Result R] and clarifies the role of [assumption].\n3) Consistency and limits. We show that our framework reduces to [standard result F] when [limit/parameter \u2192 0], and we identify where it departs from F by [quantified difference], see Proposition [X].\n4) Implications/predictions. In regime [R\u2019], our result predicts [quantified deviation/testable consequence], which can be checked via [method/experiment/computation].\n5) Scope and necessity. We prove that if [standard assumption] is retained, then [no-go/corollary], making the modification we propose essentially necessary for avoiding [the contradiction].\n\n- Paragraph 4: Relation to prior work\nOur approach differs from prior analyses in [Ref5\u2013Ref7] that address [topic] by [method], in that we [key distinction: change assumptions/prove necessity/give global construction]. Unlike [Ref8], we avoid assuming [strong hypothesis], and compared with [Ref9], we obtain [stronger/weaker but more general] conclusions under [clearer/minimal] conditions. On the physics side, our predictions are closest in spirit to [Ref10, Ref11], but we derive them from [mathematical statement], making explicit the dependence on [assumptions/parameters].\n\n- Paragraph 5: Reader\u2019s guide and notation\nThe paper is written to be self-contained. Section 2 sets notation and states assumptions [A\u2013C]. Section 3 presents the main results (Theorems 1\u20132) with proof strategy. Section 4 contains the full proofs and technical lemmas. Section 5 develops examples and consistency checks, including recovery of [standard limit] and comparison with [benchmark]. Section 6 discusses implications, limitations, and directions for empirical or computational tests. We use units/notations [conventions]; bold letters denote [objects], and calligraphic letters denote [spaces].\n\n- Paragraph 6: Tone-safe framing (optional if your claims challenge a standard theory)\nOur results do not assert that \u201cphysics is wrong.\u201d Rather, we show that the conjunction of [specific assumptions] entails [incompatibility/overconstraint] in regime [R]. One resolution is to replace [assumption X] with [assumption X\u2019] as we propose; we outline alternative resolutions in Section 6 and suggest ways they could be distinguished empirically.\n\nHow to phrase your contributions (patterns you can copy)\n- \u201cUnder assumptions A\u2013C, we prove that no function/solution/trajectory with property P can satisfy Q (Theorem 1).\u201d\n- \u201cWe construct a class of models M(\u03b8) and show they reproduce standard prediction F for \u03b8 \u2208 [I], but deviate by \u0394(\u03b8) = \u2026 outside that interval.\u201d\n- \u201cWe identify the minimal assumption\u2014locality/linearity/positivity\u2014responsible for the standard no-go result and show how relaxing it to X\u2019 yields a consistent alternative.\u201d\n- \u201cWe provide a falsifiable prediction: in setup S, our theory shifts observable O by \u03b4O = \u2026; this can be checked with [method].\u201d\n\nCommon pitfalls to avoid\n- Avoid \u201cThis proves physics is wrong.\u201d Replace with: \u201cThis shows that assumptions A\u2013C, taken together, are inconsistent with D; therefore at least one must be revised.\u201d\n- Don\u2019t bury the lede.

This framework has achieved notable successes, including [examples with citations: \\cite{Ref1,Ref2}]. Nevertheless, tensions remain in regimes where [conditions], as indicated by [observations/theorems/heuristics; \\cite{Ref3,Ref4}]. These considerations motivate a closer examination of [specific assumption/mechanism] and the underlying mathematical structure.\n\n% Paragraph 2: Gap and precise problem\nIn this work we identify a concrete limitation of the standard formulation. Under assumptions [A\u2013C], it implies [Statement S]. We show that [S] is incompatible with [Theorem/Conservation law/Empirical regularity D] in the regime [R], or else requires an additional constraint [E] that is not generally satisfied. This indicates that at least one of [A\u2013C] must be revised. We develop an alternative formulation that preserves [key desiderata] while avoiding [the identified inconsistency], and we establish its consequences rigorously.\n\n% Paragraph 3: Main results (clear, bounded claims)\nOur main results are as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Theorem 1 (Main theorem). Under assumptions [A\u2013C], no [object/solution] with property [P] can satisfy [Q]. Equivalently, [precise high-level restatement]; see \\S\\ref{sec:main-results}.\n  \\item Mechanism/Construction. We introduce [new construction/representation/variational principle] that yields [Result R] and clarifies the role of [assumption].\n  \\item Consistency and limits. In the limit [parameter/regime], our framework reduces to [standard result F; \\cite{Ref5}], while deviating by [quantified difference] when [conditions]; see Proposition [X].\n  \\item Implications. In regime [R'], the theory predicts a shift in [observable O] of magnitude [formula], suggesting [computational/experimental] checks.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n% Paragraph 4: Relation to prior work\nThis work relates to and differs from prior analyses as follows. Compared with \\cite{Ref6,Ref7}, which address [topic] by [method/assumption], we [key distinction: relax assumption, prove necessity, give global argument]. Unlike \\cite{Ref8}, we do not assume [strong hypothesis], and in contrast to \\cite{Ref9}, our conclusions hold under [weaker/clearer/minimal] conditions. On the physics side, our predictions are closest in spirit to \\cite{Ref10,Ref11}, but here they follow from [mathematical statement], making explicit the dependence on [assumptions/parameters].\n\n% Paragraph 5: Reader\u2019s guide (roadmap)\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section \\ref{sec:prelim} sets notation and states assumptions [A\u2013C]. Section \\ref{sec:main-results} presents Theorems 1\u2013[2] with proof strategy. Section \\ref{sec:proofs} contains full proofs and technical lemmas. Section \\ref{sec:examples} develops examples and consistency checks, including recovery of [standard limit] and comparison with [benchmark]. Section \\ref{sec:discussion} discusses implications, limitations, and possible empirical/computational tests.\n\n% Paragraph 6: Conventions and scope (tone-safe framing)\nWe use [units/conventions], with [boldface] denoting [vectors], [calligraphic] denoting [spaces], and [operator] for [maps]. Throughout, \u201cwe show\u201d refers to formal statements proved in the text; conjectural statements are labeled as such. Our results do not claim that \u201cphysics is wrong\u201d; rather, we demonstrate that the conjunction of [specific assumptions] entails [incompatibility/overconstraint] in regime [R]. One resolution is to replace [assumption X] with [assumption X'] as proposed here; alternative resolutions are outlined in Section \\ref{sec:discussion}.\n\n% Notes:\n% - Keep the abstract-style summary above concise and precise.\n% - Cite primary literature (recent journal papers/arXiv), not only textbooks.\n% - If you include predictions, quantify them and state how to check them.\n\n% Example section labels to match the roadmap:\n% \\section{Preliminaries and notation}\\label{sec:prelim}\n% \\section{Main results}\\label{sec:main-results}\n% \\section{Proofs}\\label{sec:proofs}\n% \\section{Examples and consistency checks}\\label{sec:examples}\n% \\section{Discussion and outlook}\\label{sec:discussion}\n\nIf you want a shorter variant, you can compress Paragraphs 2\u20133 into one paragraph and keep the itemized contributions; journals and arXiv both accept that style.",

Throughout, parameters $(\\alpha,\\beta)$ lie in the set $\\mathcal{P}$ defined in \\S\\ref{sec:prelim}.\n\n\\begin{theorem}[Descriptive name]\\label{thm:main}\nAssume \\textup{(A1)\u2013(A3)}. For any $X$ in the space $\\mathcal{X}$ with regularity $s>\\!s\\_0$, there exists a unique solution $Y=Y(X;\\alpha,\\beta)$ of \\eqref{eq:system} on $[0,T]$ such that\n\\[\n\\|Y\\|\\_{\\mathcal{Y}}\\le C\\_0(\\alpha,\\beta)\\,\\|X\\|\\_{\\mathcal{X}},\n\\]\nand if $\\alpha\\to0$ with $\\beta$ fixed, then $Y\\to Y\\_0$ in $\\mathcal{Y}$, where $Y\\_0$ solves \\eqref{eq:standard}.\n\\end{theorem}\n\nIdea of proof. The argument proceeds by [key mechanism: fixed point/energy estimate/representation]. Lemmas~\\ref{lem:coercive} and \\ref{lem:compact} yield existence; uniqueness follows from [contraction/Gr\u00f6nwall]. The small-$\\alpha$ limit uses \\Cref{prop:uniform-bounds}. Full details are in \\S\\ref{sec:proofs-main}.\n\n\\begin{proposition}[Quantitative deviation]\\label{prop:deviation}\nUnder \\textup{(A1)\u2013(A4)}, in regime $R$ we have\n\\[\n\\Delta(\\alpha,\\beta)=\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha^2) \\quad \\text{uniformly for } \\beta\\in[\\beta\\_1,\\beta\\_2],\n\\]\nso the prediction of \\eqref{eq:theory} differs from the standard result \\eqref{eq:standard} by at most $K\\alpha^2$.\n\\end{proposition}\n\n\\begin{corollary}[Recovery of the standard framework]\\label{cor:recovery}\nIf, in addition, \\textup{(A5)} holds, then \\Cref{thm:main} implies $Y=Y\\_0$ for all $t\\in[0,T]$. In particular, our formulation reduces to \\eqref{eq:standard} in the limit $[\\text{state precise limit}].$\n\\end{corollary}\n\n\\begin{theorem}[Necessity/no-go]\\label{thm:necessity}\nIf \\textup{(A1)}, \\textup{(A2)}, and the standard assumption \\textup{(S)} are all imposed, then no solution with properties \\textup{(P1)\u2013(P2)} can satisfy \\eqref{eq:system}. Hence at least one of \\textup{(A1), (A2), (S)} must be relaxed.\n\\end{theorem}\n\nRemark. This singles out [assumption X] as the source of tension; see \\S\\ref{sec:discussion} for alternative resolutions.\n\nFor physics-facing results, add a prediction theorem:\n\n\\begin{theorem}[Observable-level prediction]\\label{thm:prediction}\nLet $O$ denote the observable defined in \\eqref{eq:observable}.

For parameters $(\\alpha,\\beta)$ in the region $\\mathcal{R}$, the shift exceeds the resolution $\\epsilon$ of [experiment/computation], making the effect testable.\n\\end{theorem}\n\nCommon pitfalls to avoid\n- Vague hypotheses: \u201cregular enough,\u201d \u201csmall parameter\u201d without ranges. Always specify spaces, norms, and bounds.\n- Unstated constants: quantify constants and note their dependence on parameters.\n- Hidden assumptions: if you use compactness, boundary conditions, or decay, list them up front as (A\u2022).\n- Proof fragments in statements: keep statements clean; move technicalities to proofs or lemmas.\n- Overclaiming: if a claim is conjectural or heuristic, label it clearly.\n\nQuick checklist before you move on\n- All symbols in statements are defined earlier or immediately before use.\n- Each theorem has a descriptive name, a label, a short interpretation, and a proof location.\n- Known limits/special cases are explicitly recovered.\n- Deviations from standard predictions are quantified and tied to testable regimes (if applicable).\n- The section reads independently: a reader can skim it to grasp your contributions without diving into proofs.\n\nIf you share a rough list of your intended theorems/propositions and the assumptions you plan to use, I can help you refine the statements and suggest ordering and wording so the section lands well with your target audience.",

This framework has achieved notable successes, including [examples; \\cite{Ref1,Ref2}]. Nevertheless, in regimes where [conditions], analyses and observations suggest tensions with [principle/result], as discussed in [\\cite{Ref3,Ref4}]. These observations motivate a closer examination of [specific assumption/mechanism] and its mathematical consequences.\n\nIn this work we identify a concrete limitation of the standard formulation. Under assumptions [A\u2013C], it implies [Statement S]. We prove that [S] is incompatible with [Theorem/Conservation law/Empirical regularity D] in the regime [R], or else requires an additional constraint [E] that is not generally satisfied. This indicates that at least one of [A\u2013C] must be revised. We develop an alternative formulation that preserves [key desiderata] while avoiding [the identified inconsistency], and we establish its consequences rigorously.\n\nOur main contributions are as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Theorem 1 (Main theorem). Under [A\u2013C], [precise high-level statement]; see \\S\\ref{sec:main-results}.\n  \\item Mechanism/Construction. We introduce [new construction/representation/variational principle] that yields [Result R] and clarifies the role of [assumption].\n  \\item Consistency and limits. In the limit [parameter/regime], our framework reduces to [standard result; \\cite{Ref5}], while deviating by [quantified difference] when [conditions]; see Proposition [X].\n  \\item Implications/predictions. In setup [S], the theory predicts a shift in [observable O] of magnitude [formula], suggesting [computational/experimental] checks.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nRelation to prior work. Compared with \\cite{Ref6,Ref7}, which address [topic] by [method/assumption], we [key distinction: relax assumption, prove necessity, give global argument]. Unlike \\cite{Ref8}, we do not assume [strong hypothesis], and in contrast to \\cite{Ref9}, our conclusions hold under [weaker/clearer/minimal] conditions. On the physics side, our predictions are closest in spirit to \\cite{Ref10,Ref11}, but here they follow from [mathematical statement], making explicit the dependence on [assumptions/parameters].\n\nReader\u2019s guide. Section \\ref{sec:prelim} states assumptions [A\u2013C] and sets notation. Section \\ref{sec:main-results} presents Theorems 1\u2013[2] and proof strategy. Section \\ref{sec:proofs} contains full proofs and technical lemmas. Section \\ref{sec:examples} develops examples and consistency checks, including recovery of [standard limit] and comparison with [benchmark]. Section \\ref{sec:discussion} discusses implications, limitations, and possible empirical/computational tests. We use [units/conventions]; bold letters denote [objects], calligraphic letters denote [spaces].\n\nOptional scope sentence. Our results show that [assumptions] entail [incompatibility] in regime [R]. One resolution is to replace [assumption X] with [assumption X\u2032] as proposed here; alternative resolutions are outlined in \\S\\ref{sec:discussion}.\n\nCommon pitfalls to avoid\n- Hype or vague claims; keep statements precise and bounded.\n- Missing recent primary citations (last 5\u201310 years).\n- Unclear assumptions and notation.\n- No explicit recovery of standard results in appropriate limits.\n\nIf you want, paste a 4\u20136 sentence summary of your result and 3\u20135 key references; I\u2019ll turn it into a tailored Introduction in this structure.",
