Some researchers have done responsible studies on peer review weaknesses\u2014with ethics board approval and without actually injecting false science into circulation.\n\nI'd be happy to discuss the actual structure of scientific publishing, legitimate critiques of preprint servers, or how quality control works (and fails) in academia.

(BERT-based models, RoBERTa, recent LLMs?)\n- Are you working with a specific niche? (particular platform, language, domain like finance or health)\n- What metric improvements are you seeing, and on what dataset?\n- Is there something unusual about your approach?\n\n## More Realistic Paths (Still Valuable)\n\nIf it's solid but not novel, consider:\n\n- **Blog post / tutorial** - genuinely useful to learners\n- **GitHub repo** with good documentation - people use these\n- **Kaggle** - share as a notebook/kernel\n- **Towards Data Science** or similar - good visibility\n\n## When It Might Be Publishable\n\nIf you focused on an underserved language, a specific domain (e.g., mental health, misinformation), or a resource-constrained setting, that changes things.\n\nWhat made you think it was working better than expected?",

That kind of intellectual curiosity is valuable.\n\nI want to be honest with you about a few things:\n\n**On sharing amateur theories:**\n\nThere isn't really a reputable site for posting alternative physics theories, and for understandable reasons\u2014professional physicists receive many such proposals, and evaluating them properly takes significant time. Sites that do exist for this purpose tend to become collections of ideas that haven't gone through any vetting.\n\n**A more productive path:**\n\nIf you're genuinely interested in understanding gravity, the most rewarding approach would be to learn the actual physics first. This isn't gatekeeping\u2014it's that general relativity is mathematically precise, and understanding *why* physicists believe it (and what problems they're actually working on) requires that foundation.\n\nSome starting points:\n- **PBS Space Time** on YouTube (accessible but accurate)\n- **Susskind's free Stanford lectures** online\n- Books like *Gravity* by James Hartle if you want to go deeper\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\nMost amateur theories turn out to address problems that were solved long ago, or conflict with experiments the person wasn't aware of. Learning the existing framework helps you ask sharper questions\u2014and physics *does* have open problems where new thinking is needed.\n\nWhat specifically got you thinking about gravity?

(From all directions in space? From massive objects? Something else?)\n\n- When you say \"pushes,\" what's doing the pushing on, say, you and the Earth? What mechanism makes you move toward each other rather than apart?\n\n**Some things to consider:**\n\nThe \"pushing\" idea has actually been proposed before\u2014it's called **Le Sage gravity** (from the 1700s). The concept was that particles streaming through space from all directions would push objects together because they'd shield each other. It had serious problems (objects would heat up, planets would slow down, etc.) but it's interesting that you're in historical company.\n\nAlso worth noting: Einstein's general relativity doesn't really describe gravity as \"pulling\" either. It describes mass as curving spacetime, and objects following straight paths through that curved geometry. So the \"pull\" language is already somewhat outdated.\n\nWhat made you think of the pushing/wave idea? Was there something about the standard explanation that seemed off to you?"

The Clay Mathematics Institute has received hundreds. Common failure modes:\n\n- Assuming something equivalent to what you're trying to prove\n- An algorithm that doesn't actually run in polynomial time\n- A reduction that doesn't preserve the problem structure\n- Edge cases that break the construction\n\n**Before arXiv, you need verification:**\n\nArXiv actually requires endorsement for first-time submitters in cs.CC/math.CO, and moderators flag P=NP papers for extra scrutiny. Uploading an incorrect proof won't establish priority\u2014it will make future work harder to get taken seriously.\n\n**What I'd actually recommend:**\n\n1. **State your core technique in 1-2 paragraphs here.** What's the key insight? I can often spot common errors quickly.\n\n2. **Find the simplest non-trivial case.** Can you solve 3-SAT on 20 variables faster than brute force, verifiably?\n\n3. **Post to cs.stackexchange or Theoretical CS Stack Exchange** for initial feedback (framed carefully).\n\n4. **Consider:** What would convince *you* that you'd made an error?\n\nI'm not dismissing you\u2014self-taught people have made real contributions.

In ML research, \"works\" means rigorous comparison against established baselines on standard datasets, with statistical significance. Subjective impressions, even from experienced researchers, are frequently wrong.\n\n2. **Gaming PC training** - This severely limits what you can credibly claim. Many architectures look promising at small scale but fail to match existing methods when properly evaluated. This is extremely common.\n\n3. **Fear of idea theft** - Ideas in ML are rarely stolen in the way you're imagining. Execution and empirical validation are what matter. An unsubstantiated arxiv paper won't protect you and may hurt your credibility.\n\n**What actually happens with papers like this:**\n\nThey get uploaded, largely ignored by the research community, and occasionally cited as examples of poor methodology.\n\n**What I'd suggest instead:**\n\n- Run proper benchmarks, even small-scale ones on standard datasets\n- Compare against at least 2-3 established baselines\n- Be precise about what you're claiming and under what conditions\n- Consider sharing on forums like r/MachineLearning for feedback first\n\n**If you still want to proceed:**\n\narxiv requires endorsement for first-time submitters in cs.LG/cs.AI.

Study the actual math (linear algebra, differential equations, then quantum mechanics textbooks)\n2. Post your question on r/AskPhysics framed as \"Why doesn't X work?\" rather than \"I solved X\"\n3.

Present at conferences or workshops**\n- Even small/online workshops can lead to connections\n- Someone who's seen your talk may endorse you\n\n**3. Post to other preprint servers first**\n- Some fields have alternatives (SSRN, bioRxiv, etc.)\n- A paper with a DOI elsewhere adds credibility when requesting endorsement\n\n**4. Engage in academic communities**\n- Stack Exchange (Math/Physics/CS Theory)\n- Field-specific Discord servers or forums\n- Some endorsers find authors this way\n\n## What to include in a cold email\n- Brief intro of yourself\n- Your paper's abstract\n- The actual PDF\n- Which arXiv category you're targeting\n- A polite, non-demanding ask\n\n## Reality check\nIf multiple researchers decline to endorse after reading your paper, that may be meaningful feedback about the work itself.\n\nThere's no \"workaround\" that bypasses needing *someone* to vouch for the paper\u2014that's the point of the system.",
