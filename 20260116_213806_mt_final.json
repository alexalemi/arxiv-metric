You *can* ask targeted questions like, \u201cDoes this violate conservation of X?\u201d or \u201cIs this compatible with [specific equation]?\u201d\n\n   - **Personal blog / website / Substack / Medium**  \n     - Medium or Substack: easy to publish long-form explanations.  \n     - You can then share the link in relevant communities.  \n     This doesn\u2019t give you scientific validation, but it does make your idea publicly visible and timestamped.\n\n3. **Semi\u2011formal \u201calternative ideas\u201d repositories**  \n   These are places where many non-mainstream ideas are posted:\n\n   - **viXra.org**  \n     - An open repository specifically created because arXiv has quality/endorsement filters.  \n     - You can upload a PDF of your paper without needing an academic affiliation.  \n     - Quality varies widely; serious and non-serious work are mixed together.  \n     Still, it gives you a citable link and a timestamp.\n\n4. **Formal scientific route (hard but the only path to real acceptance)**  \n   If you genuinely think you\u2019ve found something new in quantum physics:\n\n   - **Learn and reference the standard theory**  \n     You need to show you understand:\n     - Basic quantum mechanics (Schr\u00f6dinger equation, operators, measurement postulate)\n     - Where your idea fits in or contradicts it\n   - **Write a proper paper (LaTeX is standard)**  \n     Sections: Abstract, Introduction, Background, Your Proposal, Predictions/Calculations, Discussion, References.\n   - **Preprint server: arXiv.org**  \n     - Requires an endorser or institutional affiliation for most categories.  \n     - If you\u2019re independent, this can be a major barrier.\n   - **Journals**  \n     - You can submit to a peer\u2011reviewed journal, but speculative work without solid math or testable predictions is almost always rejected.\n\n5. **Practical recommendation for you right now**  \n   Since you\u2019re coming from YouTube videos rather than formal coursework:\n\n   1. Write a short, clear document (even 3\u20135 pages) explaining your idea in plain language, and where possible, with equations.  \n   2. Post it on a public platform you control (e.g., a blog, Medium, or a GitHub repo with a PDF).  \n   3. Share the link in a place like r/PhysicsStudents or another community that allows speculative discussion.  \n   4. Use the feedback to refine your idea and, if you\u2019re serious, start learning the underlying math so you can check whether your idea is actually new and consistent.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste a rough outline or a paragraph describing your idea, and I can help you turn it into a more structured write\u2011up suitable for posting.",

For example:\n     - \u201cWe hypothesize that\u2026\u201d  \n     - \u201cWe expect that, under setting X, method Y would\u2026\u201d  \n     - \u201cDue to time/resource constraints, we were unable to run experiments A, B, C; however, based on [theory/previous work], we expect\u2026\u201d  \n   - You may include:\n     - **Theoretical analysis**: proofs, complexity analysis, convergence arguments.\n     - **Ablation or partial experiments you can reasonably run now**, even if they\u2019re smaller in scale than reviewers wanted.\n     - **Discussion/limitations section** explicitly stating:  \n       - What you did run.  \n       - What you couldn\u2019t run.  \n       - What you expect would happen and why (grounded in prior literature or theory).\n\n3. **For your thesis**  \n   - It is usually acceptable for a thesis to say: \u201cWe planned additional experiments X and Y but were unable to complete them due to time constraints.

What you\u2019re describing is academic fraud.\n\nHere\u2019s why this is a serious problem:\n\n1. **You\u2019d be lying about results.**  \n   - Saying you \u201cgot positive results\u201d when you haven\u2019t run the experiments is fabrication.  \n   - That\u2019s one of the clearest forms of research misconduct (along with falsification and plagiarism).\n\n2. **arXiv is part of the scientific record.**  \n   - Even though it\u2019s \u201cjust a preprint server,\u201d people read, cite, and build on arXiv papers.  \n   - If someone bases their work on your claimed results and later finds out they were invented, this can seriously damage your reputation and potentially your advisor\u2019s and institution\u2019s.\n\n3. **It\u2019s easy to get caught.**  \n   - When you later \u201cdo the actual work,\u201d odds are the results won\u2019t perfectly match what you made up.  \n   - Anyone who looks closely, tries to reproduce your work, or asks for code/data can expose the inconsistency.  \n   - If a collaborator, reviewer, or your advisor realizes you fabricated results, that can end a career.\n\n4. **Ethical and professional consequences.**  \n   - Most universities classify fabrication as research misconduct with possible outcomes including: formal investigation, loss of funding, expulsion/termination, and a permanent mark on your record.  \n   - Even if there\u2019s no formal case, word spreads. Academia is small.\n\n5. **There are honest alternatives.**  \n   You *can* publish or share work that isn\u2019t fully successful yet, but you must be transparent. For example:\n   - Write a **methods/ideas** paper:  \n     \u201cWe propose X. We discuss why it might work and outline how to test it.\u201d  \n     You can be explicit that experiments are preliminary or ongoing.\n   - Post **negative or partial results** honestly:  \n     \u201cWe tried X; early experiments are inconclusive / partially promising; full evaluation is future work.\u201d\n   - Submit a **workshop paper** or **extended abstract** that focuses on the idea, motivation, and planned experiments, clearly labeled as such.\n\n6. **What to do now with your situation.**  \n   - Talk to your advisor honestly:  \n     - Explain that the current line of work isn\u2019t yielding strong results yet.  \n     - Present your new idea as a promising direction and ask if you can write a short \u201cidea + preliminary plan\u201d paper or workshop submission.  \n   - Re-scope the goal:  \n     - Maybe you don\u2019t need a full, polished \u201ctop conference\u201d paper right away.  \n     - A smaller, honest contribution (a clear negative result, a new dataset, a careful analysis, a theoretical observation) is far better than a fabricated success story.\n\n7. **If you\u2019re feeling pressured:**  \n   - You are not alone; many grad students feel intense pressure to \u201chave something to show.\u201d  \n   - But crossing the line into fabrication is exactly how careers and reputations get destroyed.  \n   - It\u2019s better to have a slower start than a dishonest one.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, describe your field and the idea you have, and I can help you think of ways to frame it as a legitimate, honest contribution (e.g., idea paper, partial results, or research plan) that you *can* put on arXiv without misrepresenting anything.",

Here\u2019s a concrete template you can adapt.\n\n### 1. Choose an honest framing\n\nPick one of these angles (depending on what you actually have):\n\n- **Idea / proposal paper** \u2013 if you mostly have a concept and some theory.\n  - Title example: \u201cA Proposed Method for X Using Y\u201d\n- **Preliminary results paper** \u2013 if you\u2019ve tried a few small experiments.\n  - Title example: \u201cPreliminary Investigation of X for Y\u201d\n- **Negative/neutral results paper** \u2013 if things haven\u2019t worked well.\n  - Title example: \u201cOn the Limitations of X for Y\u201d\n\nYou do *not* need to claim strong results. Many legitimate papers are about methods, analyses, or limitations.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Skeleton structure you can follow\n\nUse this outline and fill in what you actually have:\n\n1. **Abstract**\n   - 2\u20134 sentences:\n     - Problem: \u201cWe study [problem].\u201d\n     - Idea: \u201cWe propose [method/idea].\u201d\n     - Status: \u201cWe present a preliminary analysis / design and discuss expected benefits and challenges.\u201d\n     - If you have any experiments at all: \u201cInitial experiments on [dataset/task] suggest [very cautious, honest statement].\u201d\n\n2. **Introduction**\n   - What is the problem and why it matters.\n   - What people currently do and what\u2019s missing.\n   - Your idea in 1\u20132 paragraphs.\n   - A clear honesty sentence, e.g.:\n     - \u201cThis work is primarily conceptual and outlines a method and experimental plan.\u201d\n     - or \u201cWe report preliminary experiments and discuss limitations and open questions.\u201d\n\n3. **Related Work**\n   - 1\u20133 pages summarizing:\n     - Existing methods for your problem.\n     - How your idea is similar/different.\n   - This alone can be a real contribution if it\u2019s well organized and clear.\n\n4. **Method / Proposed Approach**\n   - Describe your idea in detail:\n     - Definitions, equations, diagrams, pseudocode.\n     - Assumptions and design choices.\n   - Explain *why* you think it might work:\n     - Theoretical intuition, toy examples, connections to known results.\n   - Be explicit:\n     - \u201cWe have not yet completed a full empirical evaluation; instead we present the method and an evaluation plan.\u201d\n\n5. **(Optional but helpful) Preliminary or Toy Experiments**\n   - If you can run *small* experiments (even a simple toy setting), do it:\n     - Describe setup clearly.\n     - Report what you see, even if it\u2019s messy or weak.\n     - Phrase cautiously: \u201csuggests,\u201d \u201cindicates,\u201d \u201cappears,\u201d \u201cis inconclusive but\u2026\u201d\n   - If you *can\u2019t* run any yet, replace this section with:\n     - **\u201cPlanned Experiments\u201d**: describe datasets, baselines, metrics, and hypotheses you will test.\n\n6. **Discussion**\n   - Strengths of the idea.\n   - Potential failure modes.\n   - Open questions and what you still need to test.\n\n7. **Conclusion and Future Work**\n   - Summarize the idea.\n   - Clearly state that a full empirical validation is future work.\n   - Example: \u201cFuture work will implement the full pipeline and evaluate on [datasets] under [metrics].\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 3. Phrasing to stay honest but still interesting\n\nYou can use language like:\n\n- \u201cWe **propose** a method\u2026\u201d\n- \u201cWe **outline** an approach and an evaluation plan\u2026\u201d\n- \u201cWe **present preliminary observations** on\u2026\u201d\n- \u201cA **full empirical study is left for future work**.\u201d\n- Avoid: \u201cWe show that X outperforms Y\u201d unless you\u2019ve actually done and verified the experiments.\n\n---\n\n### 4. How to talk to your advisor\n\nYou can frame this as:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019d like to write an arXiv preprint that lays out the method and a clear experimental plan. We can then update it with full results later or turn it into a conference/journal submission once the experiments are done.\u201d\n\nAdvisors are often okay with:\n- A solid idea + clear method section.\n- A well-written related work + plan.\n- Something visible on arXiv that shows progress.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Your field (e.g., ML, physics, econ, etc.)\n- 1\u20132 sentences about your idea\n\nI can draft a more concrete mini-outline or even example paragraphs tailored to your topic that you can adapt directly.",

A generic structure you can adapt\n\nUse this basic LaTeX-style structure (works for arXiv):\n\n1. **Title**\n   - Pattern:  \n     - Empirical: \u201cA Preliminary Study of [Technique] for [Problem] in [Domain]\u201d  \n     - Method: \u201cAn Open-Source [Tool/Method] for [Task] in [Domain]\u201d  \n     - Survey: \u201cA Brief Survey of [Topic] in [Field]\u201d\n\n2. **Abstract (150\u2013250 words)**\n   - 1\u20132 sentences: problem/context  \n   - 1\u20132 sentences: what you did  \n   - 1\u20132 sentences: main findings / contribution  \n   - 1 sentence: why it matters or future work\n\n3. **Introduction (1\u20132 pages)**\n   - Define the problem and why it matters.\n   - Briefly mention current approaches.\n   - State what your paper does and your main contributions in bullet form.\n\n4. **Related Work (1\u20132 pages)**\n   - Group prior work into 2\u20134 themes.\n   - For each theme, summarize 3\u20136 key papers.\n   - End with a short paragraph: \u201cOur work differs from these in that\u2026\u201d\n\n5. **Methods / Approach (2\u20134 pages)**\n   - Describe your data or corpus (even if small or public).\n   - Describe your method clearly enough to reproduce.\n   - If it\u2019s a survey: describe your search strategy, inclusion criteria, etc.\n\n6. **Experiments / Analysis / Results (2\u20134 pages)**\n   - Describe setup (hyperparameters, tools, environment).\n   - Present 1\u20133 tables or figures.\n   - Explain what they show in words.\n\n7. **Discussion & Limitations (1\u20132 pages)**\n   - Interpret results.\n   - Be explicit about limitations (small dataset, preliminary, etc.).\n   - Suggest clear next steps.\n\n8. **Conclusion (0.5\u20131 page)**\n   - Restate the main idea and contribution.\n   - Briefly mention potential impact and future work.\n\n9. **References**\n   - Aim for at least 20\u201330 references in a survey; 10\u201320 in a short empirical paper.\n\n---\n\n## 3. A concrete \u201cstarting point\u201d you can act on today\n\nUntil you tell me your field, here is a generic template you can adapt.\n\n### Step 1: Pick a narrow, simple topic\n\nFill in:\n\n- Domain: __________________ (e.g., \u201ctext classification\u201d, \u201ctime-series forecasting\u201d, \u201cimage segmentation\u201d, \u201cX in sociology\u201d)\n- Context: __________________ (e.g., \u201cmedical notes\u201d, \u201cfinancial time series\u201d, \u201csocial media posts\u201d)\n- Angle: __________________ (e.g., \u201cbenchmarking 3 simple models\u201d, \u201csmall-scale case study\u201d, \u201cliterature review from 2019\u20132024\u201d)\n\nExample template titles:\n- \u201cA Preliminary Study of Simple Baseline Models for [Task] on [Dataset/Context]\u201d\n- \u201cA Brief Review of Recent Methods for [Problem] in [Field]\u201d\n- \u201cAn Open-Source Baseline for [Task] with [Method]: A Case Study on [Dataset/Context]\u201d\n\n### Step 2: Draft the Introduction skeleton\n\nYou can literally start with this and replace the brackets:\n\n> [Field/Problem] has received increasing attention due to [motivation/impact].  \n> Existing work has explored [brief summary of 2\u20133 major directions].  \n> However, [what is missing / what is unclear / what is not systematically evaluated].  \n>  \n> In this paper, we [what you actually do: \u201cconduct a small-scale empirical study\u201d, \u201cprovide a concise literature review\u201d, \u201cpresent an open-source implementation and baseline results\u201d].  \n>  \n> Our contributions are:\n> 1.

How I can help next\n\nIf you tell me:\n\n1. Your field and subfield (e.g., \u201ccomputer vision\u201d, \u201ccondensed matter physics\u201d, \u201cmacroeconomics\u201d, \u201cqualitative sociology\u201d),\n2. Whether you prefer:\n   - empirical study,\n   - method/tool paper,\n   - or survey/review,\n3. What resources you already have (any data, code, thesis, reports),\n\nI can:\n- Propose 2\u20133 specific paper ideas,\n- Give you a custom title + abstract draft,\n- Outline each section with bullet points you can then expand,\n- Suggest suitable arXiv categories and a template.\n\nThat way you\u2019ll have a legitimate, defensible paper that you can stand behind if anyone asks about it.",

For example:\n\n1. **Pick your best project and polish it hard**  \n   - Tighten the writing: clear motivation, clear main result, clear comparison to prior work.  \n   - Add missing experiments, proofs, ablations, error analysis, or robustness checks.  \n   - Make the figures/tables clean and informative.\n\n2. **Post a single, well-prepared arXiv preprint**  \n   - Only when the paper is in good shape\u2014don\u2019t rush.  \n   - Use a descriptive title and clear abstract with key contributions.  \n   - Upload code/data if your field expects it; it increases impact and citations.\n\n3. **Submit it to a reputable venue**  \n   - Journal or conference that is recognized in your field.  \n   - Even if it\u2019s rejected, you\u2019ll get reviews that help you improve and resubmit.  \n   - List it on your CV as \u201cunder review\u201d with the arXiv link.\n\n4. **Extract *genuinely separate* follow-up work**  \n   Only if justified, you can build more papers from the same line of research:\n   - A **methods paper** (new algorithm/model) and a separate **applications paper** (applying it in depth in one domain).  \n   - A **main result** paper and a later **extended version** with more theory, experiments, or generalization (clearly labeled as such and cross-referenced).  \n   - A **benchmark/dataset** paper and a **model** paper that uses it.\n\n   The key is: each paper should have a distinct main contribution that stands on its own.\n\n5. **Leverage collaboration**  \n   - Join ongoing projects where you can contribute something concrete (analysis, experiments, proof, implementation).  \n   - This can grow your publication list faster *without* cutting ethical corners.\n\n6. **Make your existing work more visible (without inflating counts)**  \n   - Put all preprints and published papers on a simple personal page / GitHub / Google Scholar.  \n   - Present at seminars, internal group meetings, or workshops.  \n   - Share the arXiv link with people who might actually use or cite it.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- your field (e.g., theory, ML, physics, etc.),\n- what you have right now (e.g., 1 thesis, some partial results, no papers yet),\nI can sketch a concrete 6\u201312 month plan to grow your publication record in a way that looks good to committees and won\u2019t backfire.",

You don\u2019t need to be in academia to put work in front of researchers, but you\u2019ll want to package it in the right way and put it in the right places.\n\nHere\u2019s a practical path:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Write it up like a short research paper\n\nEven if you\u2019re not submitting to a journal yet, follow the usual structure so researchers can quickly understand and evaluate it:\n\n- **Title**: Clear and specific (e.g., \u201cA Non-Minimax, Non-Neural Chess Engine That Occasionally Outperforms Stockfish in Rapid Games\u201d).\n- **Abstract**: 1 paragraph: what you did, how it differs from standard engines, and your main result.\n- **Introduction**:  \n  - What problem you\u2019re addressing.  \n  - How typical engines work (alpha\u2013beta search, evaluation, NNUE, etc.).  \n  - In one paragraph, how your method is different.\n- **Method**:  \n  - High-level algorithm description.  \n  - What\u2019s novel vs. existing approaches.  \n  - Enough detail that a strong programmer could, in principle, reimplement it.\n- **Experimental setup**:  \n  - Engine versions (your engine, Stockfish version and settings).  \n  - Time controls, hardware, opening book (or random openings), number of games.  \n  - Adjudication rules (resign threshold, move limits, etc.).\n- **Results**:  \n  - Win/draw/loss stats with confidence intervals if possible.  \n  - Any rating estimates (e.g., using BayesElo or Cutechess).  \n  - Important: show both where it wins and where it fails.\n- **Discussion / limitations**:  \n  - When it tends to beat Stockfish (time control, openings, style).  \n  - Where it\u2019s clearly weaker.  \n  - Hypotheses about why it works.\n- **Conclusion / future work**.\n\nYou can write this in Markdown or LaTeX. Clarity matters more than formality.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Make it reproducible\n\nResearchers take things more seriously if they can test them.\n\n- **Open-source the engine** (GitHub/GitLab) if you\u2019re comfortable:\n  - Code + build instructions.\n  - Default configuration used in your experiments.\n- If you can\u2019t open the full source:\n  - Provide a **binary** and a clear description of the algorithm.\n  - Include a **test suite** or scripts (e.g., Cutechess command lines) to reproduce matches.\n- Publish your **match logs/PGNs** and maybe a small set of annotated games.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Put a formal \u201cpreprint\u201d online\n\nTwo strong options:\n\n1. **arXiv** (most visible to researchers)  \n   - Category likely: `cs.AI`, `cs.GT`, or `cs.LG` depending on focus.  \n   - You normally need an \u201cendorsement,\u201d but:\n     - You can often get one by politely emailing someone who has posted related work, or\n     - Use a co-author who already has arXiv submissions (if you know anyone).\n   - Once uploaded, researchers can cite your work.\n\n2. **OpenReview / self-hosted PDF**\n   - If arXiv is a hassle, host a PDF on GitHub Pages or a personal site.\n   - Make the link easy to find from your repo.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Share it where engine and AI people actually look\n\nTarget communities where both practitioners and researchers hang out:\n\n- **Computer chess communities**:\n  - TalkChess forum (very active among engine devs).\n  - /r/chessprogramming on Reddit.\n  - The **Chess Programming Wiki**: if your method is genuinely novel, people may eventually add a page referencing it.\n\n- **AI / ML communities**:\n  - /r/MachineLearning (with a clear, technical post and a link to your paper/code).\n  - Hacker News (\u201cShow HN: A non-standard chess engine that sometimes beats Stockfish\u201d) \u2013 many researchers lurk there.\n\nWhen posting:\n\n- Lead with the **method**, not just \u201cit beats Stockfish.\u201d  \n- Be explicit about **experimental conditions** so people don\u2019t dismiss it:\n  - \u201cStockfish 16, 1+0.1, no opening book, 1k games, my engine on same hardware,\u201d etc.\n- Invite **critique and replication**.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Consider a workshop or small conference\n\nIf you want more formal academic attention:\n\n- Look for workshops at major AI/ML conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, IJCAI) on:\n  - Game playing, search, decision-making, or heuristic methods.\n- Or more specialized venues:\n  - Computer Games Workshop (CGW).\n  - IEEE Conference on Games.\n- They often accept **short papers** and are friendly to non-academic authors as long as the work is solid and clearly presented.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Be ready for skepticism (and how to handle it)\n\nClaims about \u201cbeating Stockfish\u201d get a lot of pushback, because:\n\n- Many engines can beat Stockfish under some cherry-picked settings.\n- People will ask:\n  - Which Stockfish version and configuration?\n  - What time control/hardware?\n  - How many games?\n  - Are openings randomized?\n\nYou can turn that into a positive:\n\n- Preemptively answer these in your paper and posts.\n- Offer PGNs and commands to reproduce your matches.\n- Emphasize what\u2019s interesting: **algorithmic novelty or insight**, not just \u201cstrong engine.\u201d\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, describe at a high level how your AI \u201cplays differently\u201d (e.g., not alpha\u2013beta? not evaluation-based? uses learning? something else), and I can help you draft an outline or even a first-pass abstract targeted at researchers.",

          "content": "To make a casual nature observation into something appropriate for arXiv (or at least \u201cresearch-like\u201d), you\u2019d basically need to turn it from an anecdote into a **mini study**. Here\u2019s a concrete path, step by step.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Clarify what you actually observed\n\nWrite down, as precisely as you can:\n\n- **What** you saw (species, behavior, pattern, phenomenon)\n- **Where** (location, habitat type, elevation, etc.)\n- **When** (date, time of day, season, weather)\n- **How often** (once, repeatedly, over how long?)\n\nThis helps you see whether you have:\n- A one-off \u201cweird thing\u201d\n- A repeatable pattern\n- A potentially new or under-documented behavior/occurrence\n\n---\n\n## 2. Turn it into a question or hypothesis\n\narXiv material needs some kind of **research question**, even if modest. For example:\n\n- \u201cDo [species X] preferentially use [habitat Y] at [time Z]?\u201d\n- \u201cIs [behavior A] in [species B] associated with [environmental condition C]?\u201d\n- \u201cIs [pattern] in [plant distribution / insect behavior / bird calls] consistent with [existing theory/model]?\u201d\n\nTry to phrase your observation as:\n\n> \u201cI noticed X. Could it be that Y? How can I check that?\u201d\n\nThat \u201chow can I check that\u201d is where the research part starts.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Collect more systematic data (even simple)\n\nYou usually need **more than one anecdote**. Depending on what you saw, that could mean:\n\n- **Repeat visits**  \n  - Go back to the same location at different times/days.  \n  - Note whether the phenomenon happens again, and under what conditions.\n\n- **Basic quantitative data**  \n  Examples:\n  - Counts: number of individuals, number of times a behavior occurs in a fixed time window.\n  - Timing: how long does the behavior last? What time of day does it start?\n  - Conditions: temperature, weather, light level, vegetation type, etc.\n\n- **Photographs or video**  \n  Not just for evidence, but to help others verify species, behavior, or context.\n\n- **Comparisons**  \n  - Does the same thing happen at a nearby but slightly different site?\n  - Is it different in different weather or seasons?\n\nYou don\u2019t need huge datasets, but you do need **some structure**:\n- Clear methods (how you observed/recorded)\n- Some repeated observations\n- Some way to say \u201cthis seems non-random / consistent / unusual compared to X\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 4. Check what\u2019s already known (literature search)\n\nBefore claiming anything is \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cinteresting to science,\u201d you should:\n\n- Search for:\n  - Species name + behavior/phenomenon\n  - Habitat type + pattern you noticed\n  - Broader keywords in ecology/behavior/natural history\n\n- Use:\n  - Google Scholar\n  - PubMed (for biology)\n  - Books or field guides (sometimes they mention known behaviors)\n  - iNaturalist / eBird / GBIF for occurrence patterns\n\nYou\u2019re looking for:\n- Has this behavior/pattern been documented?\n- If yes, is your observation:\n  - A confirmation in a new region?\n  - A slight variation?\n- If no, you might have:\n  - A candidate for a \u201cshort note\u201d or \u201cnatural history observation\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 5. Decide on the right *type* of output\n\nFor arXiv, you\u2019d usually need something like:\n\n- A short **research note** or **brief communication**, with:\n  - Introduction: what\u2019s known, what you\u2019re asking\n  - Methods: how you observed/recorded\n  - Results: what you found (with simple tables/figures if relevant)\n  - Discussion: what it might mean, how it fits with existing work\n  - References\n\nBut you might find your observation is better suited to:\n\n- A **natural history note** in a small journal (many ecology/ornithology/herpetology/botany societies have these)\n- A **biodiversity record** (e.g., first record of species X in location Y)\n- A **community science platform**:\n  - iNaturalist (great for species and behavior records)\n  - eBird (for birds)\n  - Local natural history society newsletter\n\nThese outlets are often more welcoming of single, well-documented observations than arXiv.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Check arXiv\u2019s scope and standards\n\narXiv is organized by subject categories (e.g., quantitative biology, physics, etc.). You\u2019d need to:\n\n- Choose a relevant category (e.g., `q-bio.PE` for Populations and Evolution, `q-bio.NC` for Neurons and Cognition, etc., if it\u2019s biology-related).\n- Make sure your work:\n  - Is written in a **scholarly style** (LaTeX or well-formatted PDF)\n  - Has **citations** to relevant literature\n  - Has a clear **research angle**, not just \u201cI saw this cool thing\u201d\n\nAlso, arXiv uses **moderation**. If it looks like:\n- A casual anecdote\n- A blog-style writeup\n- Lacking context, methods, or references\n\n\u2026it may be rejected or flagged.\n\n---\n\n## 7. A minimal viable \u201cresearch-like\u201d path\n\nIf you want the lightest-weight path toward something scientific:\n\n1. **Document carefully**  \n   - Detailed field notes + photos/video.\n\n2. **Repeat/extend the observation**  \n   - Show it\u2019s a pattern, not just a fluke.\n\n3. **Compare with existing knowledge**  \n   - One or two key papers or field guide references.\n\n4. **Write a short, structured note**  \n   - 2\u20134 pages, with intro/methods/results/discussion.\n\n5. **Target a natural history or field-specific outlet first**  \n   - Once it\u2019s accepted somewhere, you can sometimes also post a preprint on arXiv (if the field/journal norms allow).\n\n---\n\n## 8. If you\u2019d like concrete feedback\n\nIf you describe:\n\n- What you observed (species/phenomenon, roughly)\n- How many times\n- Where/when\n\nI can:\n\n- Suggest a specific kind of **study design** (what to measure, how often)\n- Propose a **possible research question** and outline sections for a short note\n- Recommend likely **outlets** (type of journal/platform) and whether arXiv makes sense in your specific case.",

Use a standard paper structure\n\nHere\u2019s a template you can fill in as you run *real* experiments:\n\n### Title (working)\n- \u201cA Simple Baseline for [Task] on [Dataset]\u201d\n- \u201cRevisiting [Method]: A Reproducibility Study on [Dataset]\u201d\n- \u201cAn Empirical Study of [Model/Technique] for [Task]\u201d\n\n### Abstract (4\u20136 sentences)\n1. Context: what problem and why it matters.\n2. What you do (method, dataset, comparison).\n3. Key quantitative result (real numbers once you have them).\n4. Main takeaway (what practitioners should learn).\n\n### 1. Introduction\n- Define the problem and why it\u2019s important.\n- Briefly mention limitations of existing work.\n- State your contributions explicitly in bullet form, e.g.:\n  - \u201cWe implement and reproduce [baseline method] on [dataset].\u201d\n  - \u201cWe systematically compare [your tweak] with standard baselines.\u201d\n  - \u201cWe release code and configuration files to support reproducibility.\u201d (Do this if you can.)\n\n### 2. Related Work\n- 4\u201310 core references.\n- Group them:\n  - Prior work on the task/dataset.\n  - Prior work on your chosen method or tweak.\n- 1\u20132 sentences per group explaining how yours differs (even if only slightly).\n\n### 3. Method\n- Describe:\n  - Model architecture (or algorithm) in enough detail to reimplement.\n  - Any modifications or \u201ctricks\u201d you use.\n  - Training details: optimizer, learning rate, batch size, epochs, regularization.\n- Be precise; this is where many \u201cfake\u201d papers fall apart, but yours will be verifiable.\n\n### 4. Experiments\n- **Datasets:** name, size, splits, preprocessing.\n- **Baselines:** what you compare against and why they are reasonable.\n- **Metrics:** accuracy, F1, AUROC, etc., and why they\u2019re appropriate.\n- **Protocol:** number of runs, seeds, train/val/test splits.\n\nYou\u2019ll fill in actual numbers once you run experiments. I can help you phrase the results section based on your real outcomes (whether they beat SOTA or not).\n\n### 5. Results & Discussion\n- Present tables/plots with:\n  - Mean \u00b1 standard deviation over multiple runs if possible.\n- Analyze:\n  - Where your method helps most / fails.\n  - Error analysis: show some failure cases.\n- It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t beat SOTA\u2014emphasize insight, clarity, and rigor.\n\n### 6. Limitations & Future Work\n- Be honest:\n  - Limited compute \u2192 smaller models/datasets.\n  - Limited hyperparameter search.\n- Suggest natural extensions:\n  - Larger datasets, more models, different domains.\n\n### 7. Conclusion\n- 1 paragraph summarizing:\n  - What you did.\n  - What you found.\n  - Why it matters for future work or practitioners.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Turn it into something resume\u2011worthy\n\nEven before formal publication, you can:\n\n- Put the project on **GitHub**:\n  - Clean README.\n  - Reproducible scripts: `train.py`, `evaluate.py`, `requirements.txt`.\n  - Example configs.\n\n- Add to your resume as:\n  - \u201cAuthor, *[Working Title]* (under preparation).\u201d\n  - Or better: \u201cResearch project: [Task] on [Dataset] \u2013 implemented X, compared against Y baselines, achieved Z% improvement over baseline on [metric].\u201d\n\nThis is honest and still impressive.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Understand what arXiv is (and isn\u2019t)\n\n- arXiv is a *preprint* server, not a journal. Submitting there does **not** mean peer review.\n- It\u2019s moderated. Submissions that look like:\n  - nonstandard physics without solid, conventional math,\n  - misunderstandings of existing theory,\n  - or work outside current research norms  \n  are often rejected or reclassified.\n\nFor a claim as strong as \u201cEinstein\u2019s equations have an error,\u201d the bar for clarity, rigor, and context is extremely high.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Create an arXiv account\n\n1. Go to: https://arxiv.org\n2. Click \u201cRegister\u201d (top right).\n3. Provide:\n   - Real name\n   - Email\n   - Affiliation (if none, you can say \u201cIndependent researcher\u201d)\n4. Confirm your email.\n\nThis only creates an account; it does **not** yet allow you to submit to all categories.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Understand endorsement\n\nMost physics categories require an **endorsement** from an existing arXiv author.\n\n- See: https://arxiv.org/help/endorsement\n- You need endorsement for the specific category you want (e.g., gr-qc, hep-th, etc.).\n- You get endorsed by:\n  - Having someone who already publishes in that category vouch for you via arXiv\u2019s system.\n\nWithout endorsement, your submission in those categories won\u2019t go through.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Choose the right category\n\nFor Einstein\u2019s equations, typical categories might be:\n\n- gr-qc (General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology)\n- hep-th (High Energy Physics \u2013 Theory)\n- math-ph (Mathematical Physics)\n\nIf your work is more conceptual and not using standard differential geometry and tensor calculus, moderators may move or reject it.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Prepare a proper paper\n\nYou need something that looks and reads like a real research article:\n\n**Structure:**\n1. Title\n2. Author(s), affiliation, email\n3. Abstract (one short paragraph: what you did and what you found)\n4. Introduction\n   - What the standard Einstein equations are.\n   - What specific aspect you are revisiting.\n   - What is already known in the literature.\n5. Main sections\n   - Clear definitions of symbols.\n   - Step-by-step derivations.\n   - Identification of where the claimed \u201cerror\u201d appears.\n   - Comparison with standard derivations in textbooks/papers.\n6. Discussion\n   - Physical implications, if any.\n   - Why this doesn\u2019t contradict existing experimental tests (or how it changes them).\n7. References\n   - Standard GR textbooks (e.g., Wald, Misner\u2013Thorne\u2013Wheeler, Carroll, etc.).\n   - Key original papers if relevant.\n\n**Format:**\n- Use LaTeX; that\u2019s the norm in physics.\n- arXiv has a LaTeX guide: https://arxiv.org/help/submit_tex\n- Avoid screenshots or calculator printouts; everything must be properly typeset.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Reality check before you submit\n\nGiven your description (\u201cI used online calculators\u201d), moderators and readers will be skeptical. Before you think about arXiv:\n\n1. **Re-derive everything by hand**  \n   Don\u2019t rely on calculators alone. You must understand each step symbolically.\n\n2. **Compare with multiple sources**  \n   - Check standard derivations of Einstein\u2019s equations from:\n     - the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action,\n     - the variation with respect to the metric,\n     - conservation of the stress-energy tensor, etc.\n   - Confirm you\u2019re not rediscovering a known convention change (signs, metric signature, units, etc.).\n\n3. **Ask for expert feedback**  \n   - Post a *precise*, self-contained question on Physics Stack Exchange (https://physics.stackexchange.com):\n     - Show the standard equation you think is wrong.\n     - Show your derivation.\n     - Ask: \u201cWhere does my reasoning differ from the standard derivation?\u201d\n   - Or email a local university physicist with a short, clear PDF and ask if your key step is correct.\n\nIf you can\u2019t convince at least one expert that your derivation is even *plausible*, arXiv submission is likely to be rejected or ignored.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Getting endorsement\n\nIf, after that, your work still stands up:\n\n1. Identify researchers in GR or related fields:\n   - Look up authors of recent arXiv papers in gr-qc or hep-th.\n2. Write a short, professional email:\n   - Attach your PDF.\n   - Explain in a few sentences what you claim and what part is new.\n   - Politely ask if they would consider endorsing your submission *if* they find it technically sound.\n3. Alternatively, if you know someone with arXiv submissions already, ask them directly.\n\nNo one is obligated to endorse you; they risk their reputation if the work is clearly flawed.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Submitting on arXiv\n\nOnce you\u2019re endorsed and your paper is ready:\n\n1. Log in to arXiv.\n2. Click \u201cSubmit\u201d \u2192 follow the steps.\n3. Upload your LaTeX source (and figures).\n4. Select the primary category (e.g., gr-qc).\n5. Fill in title, abstract, authors.\n6. Submit and wait for moderation (usually hours to a couple of days).\n\nIt will either:\n- Be accepted and appear with an arXiv ID, or\n- Be put on hold/rejected, sometimes with a brief note.\n\n---\n\n## 9. If you mainly want priority\n\nIf your goal is \u201cI want proof I had this idea first,\u201d but you\u2019re not yet ready for arXiv:\n\n- Put a dated, immutable record somewhere:\n  - Upload a PDF to a personal website or GitHub repository (with a timestamp).\n  - Use a preprint server with lighter moderation (e.g., OSF preprints).\n  - Email the PDF to yourself from a trusted email (not ideal, but a soft timestamp).\n\nThis doesn\u2019t carry the same scientific weight as arXiv or a journal, but it\u2019s something.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, you can paste the exact form of Einstein\u2019s equations you think is wrong and the key steps of your derivation. I can help you check whether what you\u2019ve found is a genuine inconsistency, a sign convention issue, or a misunderstanding, and then help you structure it into a paper-like form.",

          "content": "There are a few different kinds of places you can share ideas, depending on what you\u2019re looking for:\n\n### 1. Discussion forums (best starting point)\n\nThese are good if you want feedback, questions, and conversation, even if your ideas are very speculative.\n\n- **Physics Stack Exchange (physics.stackexchange.com)**  \n  Very strict. They generally do *not* allow personal theories or non-standard physics. Good for learning standard physics, not for proposing alternatives.\n\n- **Reddit communities**  \n  - **r/Physics** \u2013 Focused on mainstream physics; they usually don\u2019t allow personal theories.  \n  - **r/AskPhysics** \u2013 For questions, not for new theories.  \n  - **r/PhysicsStudents** \u2013 Good for learning and clarifying concepts.  \n  - **r/BadPhysics / r/EverythingScience** \u2013 Mixed quality, but sometimes open to more speculative discussion.  \n  - **r/ScienceDiscussion** \u2013 More open-ended discussion, but still prefers evidence-based topics.  \n  - **r/TheoreticalPhysics** or **r/PhysicsTheory** (if active) \u2013 Sometimes more tolerant of speculation, but check the rules.\n\n- **Physics Forums (physicsforums.com)**  \n  Very reputable and education-focused. They do *not* allow personal theories, but they\u2019re excellent if you want to understand what current theory says so you can refine your thinking.\n\nIf you mainly want to *learn* and test whether your idea conflicts with known results, Physics Forums + Physics Stack Exchange are ideal. If you mainly want to *share* and explore speculative ideas, some subreddits or more general science forums are better.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Places specifically for alternative / speculative ideas\n\nThese are more welcoming to non-mainstream thinking, but the scientific quality can be very uneven:\n\n- **viXra.org**  \n  An open repository created as a more permissive alternative to arXiv. Anyone can upload a paper. There is no peer review or quality filter, so it\u2019s easy to post but harder to be taken seriously by professional physicists.\n\n- **ResearchGate**  \n  Mostly for professional researchers, but some non-academics use it. You\u2019d typically be expected to upload something like a paper or preprint.\n\n- **Personal blog / website / Medium / Substack**  \n  You can write up your ideas in detail and then share the link with others. This gives you full control and a permanent place to point people to.\n\n---\n\n### 3. If you want scientists to seriously engage\n\nProfessionals will usually only look at new ideas if:\n\n1. They\u2019re written in a clear, mathematical way.\n2. They show awareness of existing theory (GR, quantum mechanics, etc.).\n3. They make testable predictions or explain known phenomena *better* than current theories.\n\nSo a good path is:\n\n1. **Write your idea up carefully**  \n   - State what you\u2019re changing about gravity.  \n   - Show how it recovers known results (e.g., Newtonian gravity at low speeds, GR tests like light bending, GPS, gravitational waves).  \n   - Be explicit about the equations or logic.\n\n2. **Ask specific, focused questions** on mainstream sites  \n   For example: \u201cIf gravity worked like X instead of curvature of spacetime, would this contradict observation Y?\u201d  \n   This is allowed on Physics Stack Exchange and Physics Forums if you frame it as a question about consistency with known physics, not as \u201cmy new theory.\u201d\n\n3. **Refine based on feedback**, then, if you\u2019re serious, you could:\n   - Post a preprint to viXra (or, with enough rigor and an academic endorser, arXiv).  \n   - Try to submit a paper to a journal (this is hard without strong math and background, but not impossible).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Practical suggestion tailored to you\n\nSince you said you\u2019re not a scientist and just thinking in your spare time, a reasonable path is:\n\n1. Draft your idea in a document (even a Google Doc): what gravity is in your view, how it differs from Einstein, and what it would predict.\n2. Post a *summary* on a suitable subreddit (e.g., a more open science discussion subreddit) and ask:  \n   \u201cWhere does this conflict with known experimental results about gravity?\u201d  \n3. Use Physics Stack Exchange or Physics Forums to ask very targeted questions like:  \n   \u201cIn GR, what experimental result rules out a model where gravity does X?\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can describe your idea briefly here, and I can help you:  \n- Turn it into a clearer write-up, and  \n- Suggest where and how to post it to get the most useful kind of feedback.",

I\u2019ll outline a simple way to turn your idea into something you can share, and then we can fill it in together once you describe the idea.\n\n## 1. First, tell me your idea in plain language\n\nYou don\u2019t need equations yet. Just describe:\n\n- What you think gravity *is* or how it works.\n- How that\u2019s different from:\n  - Newton\u2019s picture (a force between masses),\n  - or Einstein\u2019s (curved spacetime / objects following geodesics).\n- Any specific things you want it to explain (e.g., galaxy rotation, dark matter, cosmic expansion, why things fall, etc.).\n\nYou can just write a few paragraphs like you\u2019re explaining it to a curious friend.\n\n---\n\n## 2. I\u2019ll help you turn it into a basic \u201ctheory write-up\u201d\n\nOnce you describe it, I can help you structure it roughly like a short paper or blog post. A simple template:\n\n1. **Motivation**  \n   - What bothers you about current gravity theories?  \n   - What question are you trying to answer?\n\n2. **Core idea**  \n   - A clear statement: \u201cIn this model, gravity is \u2026\u201d  \n   - How it differs from Einstein\u2019s GR / Newtonian gravity.\n\n3. **Qualitative predictions**  \n   - What your idea would say about:\n     - Why objects fall on Earth\n     - Orbits (planets around the Sun)\n     - Light near massive objects (bending of light)\n     - Maybe cosmology (if relevant)\n\n4. **Where it might be tested / might fail**  \n   - Are there any experiments or observations that would clearly contradict it?\n   - Or any phenomena it would naturally explain?\n\nYou don\u2019t need all the math to start; you just need the idea to be internally consistent and clearly stated. I can help you clean up the language and make it easier for others to follow.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to present it online (once we\u2019ve written it up)\n\nAfter we refine your write-up, you can:\n\n- Post the *full version* on:\n  - A blog (Medium, Substack, personal website), or\n  - A PDF on Google Drive / Dropbox / similar.\n\n- Post a *short summary* plus a link on:\n  - A more open science discussion subreddit (not r/Physics itself, which bans personal theories).\n  - Possibly a general discussion forum that allows speculative ideas.\n\nThe key is to **frame it as exploratory and humble**, for example:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m a non-professional thinking about gravity. I know this probably has issues, but I\u2019d like to understand *where* it conflicts with known experiments or standard theory. Here\u2019s a short summary; full write-up is linked.\u201d\n\nThat tone makes people more willing to engage constructively.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Getting more technical feedback (optional, next step)\n\nIf you want more serious critique later, I can help you:\n\n- Turn your idea into more formal statements (and, where possible, simple equations).\n- Extract *specific questions* you can ask on places like Physics Stack Exchange or Physics Forums, such as:\n  - \u201cWould a gravity model where X happens be ruled out by observation Y?\u201d\n  - \u201cIn GR, which experiment shows that Z cannot be true about gravity?\u201d\n\nThose sites won\u2019t entertain \u201cHere is my new theory,\u201d but they *will* answer \u201cWould this idea contradict this specific experimental result?\u201d\n\n---\n\nSo, next step:  \nGo ahead and describe your gravity idea in your own words\u2014no need to make it perfect. Just type what you\u2019ve been thinking, and I\u2019ll help you turn it into a clear, structured version you can share.",

But I can give you a very concrete starting point for an honest paper that works under tight compute limits.\n\nHere are three practical paths you can choose from, with step\u2011by\u2011step outlines you can directly build on.\n\n---\n\n## Option 1: A Small\u2011Compute Empirical Paper\n\n### 1. Choose a feasible problem\nPick something that:\n- Trains in minutes to a couple of hours on CPU or a free GPU.\n- Has simple baselines.\n\nExamples:\n- Text classification on a small dataset (e.g., AG News, Yelp polarity, SST\u20112).\n- Image classification on MNIST/Fashion\u2011MNIST/CIFAR\u201110 (with small models).\n- Tabular classification/regression (UCI datasets).\n\n### 2. Choose a lightweight model idea\nInstead of inventing a huge new architecture, focus on:\n- A **simple modification** to an existing model (e.g., different regularization, loss, or initialization).\n- A **training trick** (e.g., curriculum learning, label smoothing, simple data augmentation).\n- A **resource\u2011aware variant** (e.g., pruning, quantization, or low\u2011rank adaptation on a small model).\n\nYou can tell me your idea and I\u2019ll help refine it into something testable with low compute.\n\n### 3. Design an experiment you can actually run\nExample for text classification:\n\n- Dataset: AG News (train: 120k, test: 7.6k).\n- Models:\n  - Baseline: simple BiLSTM or small CNN.\n  - Your method: same model + your modification.\n- Metrics: accuracy, F1 (macro/micro).\n- Training:\n  - Epochs: 5\u201310.\n  - Batch size: 32\u201364.\n  - Optimizer: Adam.\n  - Learning rate: 1e\u20113 (with or without decay).\n\nI can write:\n- The full experimental protocol section.\n- Pseudocode for training.\n- Example PyTorch code (CPU\u2011friendly).\n\nYou then:\n- Run the code (e.g., Colab/Kaggle).\n- Log real curves (loss/accuracy vs. epoch).\n- Export real tables.\n\n---\n\n## Option 2: A Theoretical / Conceptual Paper\n\nNo heavy experiments needed.\n\n### 1. Pick a topic where theory or conceptual clarity is valuable\nExamples:\n- A new perspective on existing architectures (e.g., transformers as message\u2011passing on graphs).\n- An analysis of why a known trick works (e.g., label smoothing, dropout, gradient clipping).\n- A toy theoretical model of alignment, robustness, or generalization.\n\n### 2. Structure of the paper\nYou can follow:\n\n1. **Introduction**\n   - Problem statement.\n   - Why current understanding is lacking.\n   - Your proposed perspective or result.\n\n2. **Background**\n   - Formalize the setting (e.g., supervised learning, specific architecture).\n   - Define notation.\n\n3. **Main Contribution**\n   - Theorems / propositions / lemmas.\n   - Intuitive explanation alongside formal statements.\n   - Proof sketches or full proofs.\n\n4. **Toy Experiments (Optional, Very Small)**\n   - One or two minimal experiments on synthetic or tiny data to illustrate the theory.\n   - These are easy to run and don\u2019t need big compute.\n\n5. **Discussion**\n   - Limitations.\n   - How this might scale or be tested in larger systems.\n\nI can:\n- Help you formalize definitions and claims.\n- Help draft proofs or proof sketches.\n- Suggest minimal toy experiments you can run in seconds.\n\n---\n\n## Option 3: A Survey / Position Paper\n\nNo experiments required, but still publishable if done well.\n\n### 1. Choose a focused topic\nGood targets:\n- \u201cEvaluation of X\u201d (e.g., instruction\u2011following, robustness, calibration).\n- \u201cEfficient fine\u2011tuning methods for language models.\u201d\n- \u201cSafety/robustness methods for generative models.\u201d\n- \u201cData curation and filtering for LLM training.\u201d\n\n### 2. Structure\n1. **Introduction**\n   - Scope and motivation.\n   - What\u2019s missing in existing surveys.\n\n2. **Taxonomy**\n   - Define categories (e.g., for efficient fine\u2011tuning: LoRA, prefix tuning, adapters, quantization\u2011aware training, etc.).\n   - For each: core idea, pros/cons, typical use cases.\n\n3. **Comparison and Critique**\n   - Compare methods qualitatively: assumptions, compute cost, robustness, data requirements.\n   - Highlight inconsistencies in the literature (e.g., different evaluation protocols).\n\n4. **Open Problems / Future Directions**\n   - Where empirical evidence is missing.\n   - Proposed standardized evaluation setups.\n\nI can:\n- Help you build the taxonomy.\n- Draft section outlines.\n- Suggest key papers to include (with citations up to 2024).\n\n---\n\n## Concrete \u201cFirst Page\u201d You Can Use\n\nHere\u2019s a skeleton you can adapt for a small\u2011compute empirical paper:\n\n-Title:  \n\u201cLightweight [Method Name]: Improving [Task] Under Strict Compute Constraints\u201d\n\n- Abstract (template)\n\u201cWe propose [brief description of method], a simple modification to [baseline model or training procedure] for [task]. Unlike prior work that relies on large\u2011scale models and extensive compute, our approach is designed to be evaluated on modest hardware. We conduct experiments on [datasets] using small models with at most [X] parameters and report [metrics]. Our results show that [key qualitative takeaway: e.g., consistent improvements over baselines, robustness to limited data, etc.], while requiring less than [Y] GPU hours. We discuss the limitations of our study and outline how future work can scale and validate these findings on larger systems.\u201d\n\n- Introduction (outline)\n1. Problem + why it matters.\n2. Limitations of current work (compute\u2011heavy, inaccessible).\n3. Your method in one paragraph.\n4. Your contributions:\n   - A simple method for [task] that works under strict compute limits.\n   - A transparent, low\u2011resource experimental setup that others can reproduce.\n   - An analysis of [property: robustness, data efficiency, etc.].\n\nI can help you fill this in once you decide:\n- The task (e.g., text classification, small\u2011scale translation, image classification).\n- The kind of idea you\u2019re interested in (optimization trick, architecture tweak, evaluation method, etc.).\n- What hardware you actually have (CPU only, free Colab GPU, etc.).\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n1) What topic in AI you\u2019re most interested in (e.g., NLP, vision, RL, theory, safety), and  \n2) What compute you actually have (e.g., \u201cCPU laptop, 16GB RAM\u201d or \u201cColab with occasional T4 GPU\u201d),  \n\nI\u2019ll propose a concrete project idea and give you:\n- A draft title.\n- Section structure.\n- Experimental design (if empirical).\n- What you need to implement/run yourself to get real curves and tables.",

Many papers later go through peer review and are published in journals; arXiv just makes them available early.\n\n### Who can submit?\n\narXiv is mainly for **researchers**. To submit, you typically need:\n\n- An arXiv account, and\n- Either:\n  - An institutional email (e.g., university or research lab), or\n  - An endorsement from someone already active on arXiv in that subject area\n\nThis is to keep out crackpot submissions and maintain a baseline of seriousness.\n\n### Can a \u201cregular person\u201d contribute?\n\nIt depends what you mean by \u201ccontribute\u201d:\n\n- **Reading and learning**:  \n  Yes, absolutely. Anyone can:\n  - Read papers\n  - Follow trends in a field\n  - Use it as a reference for self-study (though the material is often technical)\n\n- **Submitting your own paper**:\n  - If you\u2019re not affiliated with a university or research lab, it\u2019s *harder but not impossible*.\n  - You would likely need:\n    - A serious, properly written paper (LaTeX format is standard)\n    - To choose the right category (e.g., cs.LG for machine learning, math.PR for probability)\n    - An endorsement from an existing arXiv author in that category  \n  - If your work looks like \u201cpersonal theory\u201d without math, data, or connection to existing literature, it\u2019s likely to be rejected.\n\n### How it fits into science\n\n- Many scientists post their papers to arXiv **before** journal publication so:\n  - Others can read and cite them sooner\n  - They can establish priority (\u201cwe did this first\u201d)\n- People on \u201cscience Twitter\u201d often:\n  - Share arXiv links to new papers\n  - Discuss or critique them informally\n\n### If you\u2019re curious and not a researcher\n\nYou can:\n\n- Browse: https://arxiv.org\n- Use the \u201crecent\u201d or \u201csearch\u201d features\n- Start with:\n  - Survey/review papers (they often have \u201csurvey\u201d or \u201creview\u201d in the title)\n  - Papers tagged as \u201ctutorial\u201d or \u201cintroduction\u201d in the abstract\n\nIf you\u2019d like, describe your background and interests (e.g., math level, topics you like), and I can point you to the kinds of arXiv papers that are actually readable and useful for you.",

Cosmology & the universe\n\n1. **\u201cAn Introduction to the Science of Cosmology\u201d**  \n   - arXiv: `astro-ph/0009499`  \n   - Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0009499  \n   - What it\u2019s like: A broad overview of cosmology.

Some technical parts, but the intro and conclusion are readable.\n\n### B. Black holes & general relativity (conceptual)\n\n4. **\u201cA Short Course on General Relativity\u201d (lecture notes)**  \n   - arXiv: `gr-qc/9712019`  \n   - Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9712019  \n   - What it\u2019s like: Full course notes, so they *do* use calculus, but you can read the first sections for conceptual explanations of spacetime, curvature, etc.\n\n5. **\u201cAn Introduction to Black Holes, Information, and the String Theory Revolution\u201d (book draft)**  \n   - arXiv: `hep-th/0408044`  \n   - Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0408044  \n   - What it\u2019s like: Long and technical in places, but the early chapters explain black holes and information in a fairly narrative way. You can treat it like a book to dip into.\n\n---\n\n## 2. AI / Machine Learning\n\nMany AI papers are math-heavy, but some are written as **tutorials or surveys** and are readable at a high level.\n\n### A. General introductions / overviews\n\n1. **\u201cA Brief Introduction to Machine Learning for Engineers\u201d**  \n   - arXiv: `1709.02840`  \n   - Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02840  \n   - What it\u2019s like: High-level overview with intuition and diagrams. You can skip the formulas and still understand the main ideas.\n\n2. **\u201cDeep Learning\u201d (Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville \u2013 book draft)**  \n   - arXiv: `1409.0473`  \n   - Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473  \n   - What it\u2019s like: This is the classic deep learning textbook draft.  \n     - Chapters 1\u20133 are mostly conceptual and history/overview.  \n     - Later chapters get more technical; you can stop when it gets too dense.\n\n3. **\u201cA Survey on Deep Learning in Medical Image Analysis\u201d**  \n   - arXiv: `1602.06541`  \n   - Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06541  \n   - What it\u2019s like: Shows how AI is used on medical images. Good for seeing real-world applications, with lots of pictures and less focus on math details.\n\n### B. AI safety / societal impact (usually less mathy)\n\n4. **\u201cConcrete Problems in AI Safety\u201d**  \n   - arXiv: `1606.06565`  \n   - Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565  \n   - What it\u2019s like: Explains specific safety issues (reward hacking, side effects, etc.) in mostly plain language. You can understand most of it with high-school math.\n\n5. **\u201cThe Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence: Forecasting, Prevention, and Mitigation\u201d**  \n   - arXiv: `1802.07228`  \n   - Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07228  \n   - What it\u2019s like: Focuses on how AI could be misused (cyberattacks, fake media, etc.). Very little math; more policy/strategy.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to find similar papers yourself\n\nOn arXiv:\n\n1. Go to **https://arxiv.org**\n2. For **space**, choose category:\n   - `astro-ph` (Astrophysics), especially:\n     - `astro-ph.CO` (Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics)\n3. For **AI**, choose:\n   - `cs.LG` (Machine Learning)  \n   - `cs.AI` (Artificial Intelligence)  \n   - `stat.ML` (Machine Learning from statistics side)\n\nThen in the search box, try adding words like:\n- `survey`\n- `review`\n- `tutorial`\n- `introduction`\n- `lecture notes`\n\nExample searches:\n- `cat:astro-ph.CO survey dark energy`\n- `cat:cs.LG tutorial neural networks`\n- `cat:cs.AI survey reinforcement learning`\n\nThese keywords tend to surface more \u201cbig picture\u201d and educational papers.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me which of these (space vs AI, or even which paper) you actually open and find readable, I can adjust and recommend more in that specific style and difficulty."

The only ethical options are:\n\n1. **Write a theoretical / proposal-style paper honestly**  \n   You can:\n   - Present the **idea**, formalism, and algorithm.\n   - Provide **theoretical analysis**, proofs, or complexity arguments.\n   - Clearly label everything as **proposed / future work**:\n     - \u201cWe propose\u2026\u201d\n     - \u201cWe hypothesize that\u2026\u201d\n     - \u201cWe plan to evaluate this by\u2026\u201d\n   - Avoid any language implying you already implemented or empirically validated it.\n\n   This is acceptable if the contribution is genuinely conceptual/theoretical, and you\u2019re transparent about what has and hasn\u2019t been done.\n\n2. **Actually implement a minimal version and report real results**  \n   You don\u2019t need a huge project:\n   - Build a basic prototype.\n   - Run small-scale or toy experiments.\n   - Be honest about limitations: \u201cPreliminary results on a small dataset suggest\u2026\u201d\n   - You can still frame it as early-stage work.\n\n3. **Turn it into a research statement, not a \u201cpaper\u201d**  \n   For grad school applications, admissions committees often care more about:\n   - A **research statement** describing ideas you\u2019d like to pursue.\n   - Evidence that you understand the literature and can think clearly about problems.\n   \n   You can write a detailed, well-structured \u201cmini-paper\u201d or research plan and include it as:\n   - An attachment titled \u201cResearch Proposal\u201d or \u201cOngoing Work (Conceptual)\u201d\n   - A section in your statement of purpose.\n\n   This lets you showcase the idea without misrepresenting it as completed research.\n\n4. **Collaborate with a mentor or lab and develop it properly**  \n   If possible:\n   - Reach out to a professor whose interests match your idea.\n   - Ask if you can work on it as an independent study or small project.\n   - Even partial progress with a supervisor\u2019s name on it is more credible and ethical.\n\n5. **Use arXiv only when the work is real and stable enough**  \n   A preprint doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, but it should:\n   - Accurately describe what you have done.\n   - Not fabricate data, results, or implementation details.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, describe your idea and your current time/resources, and I can help you:\n\n- Reshape it into an honest early-stage paper or note (with clear \u201cproposed\u201d framing), or  \n- Turn it into a strong research statement section for your grad applications.",

For example, [short example]. This limits their applicability to [scenario]. I am interested in developing methods that [what you want to achieve].\n\n### Your Idea (Concept)\n> I propose to explore an approach based on [core idea: e.g., hierarchical models, new loss, new optimization, etc.]. The central hypothesis is that [clear hypothesis], which could address [limitation] by [mechanism].\n\nBe explicit that this is **proposed work**:\n- \u201cI plan to investigate\u2026\u201d\n- \u201cI would like to develop\u2026\u201d\n- \u201cI aim to test the hypothesis that\u2026\u201d\n\n### Relation to Existing Work\n> This direction builds on prior work in [briefly cite 2\u20133 key ideas or papers], which have shown that [what they do well].

          "content": "You can\u2019t submit directly to arXiv as an unaffiliated individual unless you clear one of a few gates. Here\u2019s how it works and what to do instead/alongside it.\n\n## 1. How arXiv submission actually works\n\nTo submit to arXiv you need:\n\n1. **An arXiv account**  \n   - You create one at: https://arxiv.org  \n   - They\u2019ll ask for your name, email, and **affiliation** (university, company, or \u201cindependent researcher\u201d).\n\n2. **Authorization to submit in a subject area**  \n   - arXiv doesn\u2019t let every new account post in physics automatically.\n   - You usually need **endorsement** by someone who is already an author in that category (e.g., hep-th, gr-qc, astro-ph, etc.), *or* you must be in an institution that arXiv recognizes.\n\n3. **A properly formatted paper**  \n   - Usually written in **LaTeX**, compiled to PDF.\n   - It must look like a standard physics paper: title, abstract, intro, equations, references, etc.\n\nIf you\u2019re unaffiliated and unknown, the main barrier is **endorsement**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Endorsement: the main hurdle\n\nEach arXiv subject area has a list of endorsers (not public, but any active author in that category can often endorse).\n\nYou can:\n\n1. **Register an account**, then\u2026\n2. Try to submit a paper to a specific category (e.g., `gr-qc` or `hep-th`).\n3. arXiv will tell you that you need an **endorsement** and will give you a way to **request endorsement**.\n\nWhen requesting endorsement:\n\n- You\u2019ll be asked for:\n  - Title and abstract.\n  - Sometimes a link to a draft.\n- An endorser will receive a request and decide (often quickly) whether your submission looks like real research or crackpot material.\n\nIf your paper:\n- Has no references,\n- Uses nonstandard notation without explanation,\n- Makes huge claims without calculations,\n- Ignores known results,\n\nthen the endorser will likely decline. So the **presentation** matters as much as the content.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to structure your theory as a serious paper\n\nEven if your idea is revolutionary, you must present it in the standard format. At minimum:\n\n1. **Title**  \n   - Clear and technical, not grandiose.  \n   - Example: \u201cA Classical Field Model for Flat Galactic Rotation Curves Without Dark Matter\u201d\n\n2. **Abstract (1 paragraph)**  \n   - What problem you address.\n   - What you propose.\n   - Main result(s).\n   - How it compares to existing theories.\n\n3. **Introduction**  \n   - Explain the context: dark matter, current status, key observational facts.\n   - Cite standard sources: \u039bCDM, rotation curves, CMB, structure formation, etc.\n   - State clearly: what is new in your approach.\n\n4. **Theory / Model section(s)**  \n   - Define your fields, equations, and assumptions *precisely*.\n   - Show how they follow from an action or set of postulates.\n   - Derive key equations step by step.\n\n5. **Phenomenology / Predictions**  \n   - Show how your model reproduces:\n     - Galaxy rotation curves,\n     - Gravitational lensing,\n     - CMB constraints, etc., if you claim to \u201cexplain dark matter.\u201d\n   - Include **computations, plots, or fits** to data if at all possible.\n\n6. **Comparison with existing work**  \n   - Show you understand current dark matter models and modified gravity attempts (MOND, TeVeS, f(R), etc.).\n   - Explain how your model differs and what it does better/worse.\n\n7. **Conclusion**  \n   - Summarize main results and predictions.\n   - Suggest tests that could falsify your theory.\n\n8. **References**  \n   - Use standard references (review articles, classic papers).\n   - This shows you\u2019ve engaged with the existing literature.\n\nI can help you:\n- Turn your notes into a standard structure.\n- Rewrite sections for clarity.\n- Suggest where you need more derivation or references.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Practical steps you can take right now\n\n### Step 1: Write a clean draft (even in plain text first)\n\nIf you don\u2019t know LaTeX yet, just write in plain text/Word/Google Docs with:\n\n- Clear section headings: Introduction, Model, Results, Discussion, etc.\n- Numbered equations.\n- References listed at the end (even if not formatted perfectly yet).\n\nYou can paste parts here, and I can:\n\n- Help you rewrite them in more standard physics language.\n- Point out where reasoning is unclear or incomplete.\n\n### Step 2: Move to LaTeX (optional but strongly recommended)\n\narXiv strongly prefers LaTeX. You can:\n\n- Use Overleaf (online LaTeX editor): https://www.overleaf.com\n- Start from a template (e.g., \u201carticle\u201d class, or an APS-style template).\n\nI can:\n- Help you convert specific equations or sections into LaTeX.\n- Provide a minimal LaTeX template you can paste into Overleaf.\n\n### Step 3: Decide on the correct category\n\nFor a \u201cunified field theory\u201d that explains dark matter, likely categories:\n\n- `gr-qc` (General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology)\n- `hep-th` (High Energy Physics \u2013 Theory)\n- `astro-ph.CO` (Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics), if you focus on dark matter phenomenology.\n\nWe can choose based on the content once I see a bit of it.\n\n### Step 4: Create arXiv account and attempt submission\n\n- Register at arxiv.org.\n- Upload your PDF (and LaTeX source if you have it).\n- Choose the primary category.\n- If it asks for endorsement, follow the instructions to request it.\n\nOutcome possibilities:\n\n- **Endorsement granted** \u2192 your paper gets posted (possibly after a moderation delay).\n- **Endorsement denied / moderation rejects** \u2192 you won\u2019t be able to post that version, but you still have other options (see below).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Realistic expectations and alternatives\n\nEven if your work is brilliant, the odds are against fast acceptance because:\n\n- Many nonstandard submissions are low-quality, so moderators and endorsers are cautious.\n- A garage-developed \u201cunified field theory\u201d triggers a lot of skepticism by default.\n\nTo get real physicists to look at it, you should also consider:\n\n1. **vixra.org**  \n   - Much easier to upload; no endorsement.\n   - Less prestige, but at least your work is publicly available with a timestamp.\n\n2. **A personal website or GitHub**  \n   - Host your PDF and maybe code/notebooks if you have computations.\n\n3. **Emailing a few relevant researchers**  \n   - Very short, respectful email with:\n     - 1\u20132 sentence summary of your idea.\n     - Link to a PDF.\n   - Many will ignore it, but occasionally someone skims.\n\n4. **Physics forums / Stack Exchange**  \n   - You can ask *specific* technical questions, not \u201cIs my grand theory right?\u201d\n   - Example: \u201cDoes this modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action necessarily violate solar system tests?\u201d with equations.\n\n---\n\n## 6. How I can help you concretely\n\nIf you want to move forward:\n\n1. Paste:\n   - Your **abstract** (or a rough version of it),\n   - And a short outline of your main idea (even if rough).\n\n2. I\u2019ll:\n   - Help you shape a proper abstract.\n   - Suggest a good title and arXiv category.\n   - Point out any obviously fatal theoretical issues (to the extent possible from text).\n   - Help you rewrite sections in a more \u201cprofessional\u201d style.\n\n3. When you\u2019re ready:\n   - I can give you a minimal LaTeX template tailored to your paper.\n   - Help format a couple of your main equations in LaTeX.\n\nIf you share some of your draft (even just the intro and main claim), I can start by helping you make it look and read like a serious physics paper, which is essential for any chance at arXiv endorsement.",

I discuss observational tests that could distinguish this framework from standard \\(\\Lambda\\)CDM and other modified gravity theories, in particular [list 1\u20132: e.g. \u201cprecision measurements of weak lensing profiles around galaxies\u201d / \u201cdeviations in cluster dynamics\u201d].\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Minimal info I need from you\n\nIf filling the whole template feels like too much, just answer these in one or two sentences each, and I\u2019ll build the abstract for you:\n\n1. **Core idea:**  \n   - What new thing do you introduce?

(e.g. galaxy rotation curves, lensing by galaxies, cosmology, something else?)\n3. **Mathematical backbone:**  \n   - Do you have an action/Lagrangian? Modified Einstein equations? A specific potential \\(V(\\phi)\\)? Name the key object(s).\n4. **One or two concrete results:**  \n   - Example: \u201cI derive a modified Poisson equation \u2026\u201d, \u201cI get a specific formula for the rotation velocity \\(v(r)\\) \u2026\u201d, \u201cI show the model reproduces a Tully\u2013Fisher\u2013like relation \u2026\u201d.\n5. **How it differs from existing ideas:**  \n   - Is it closer to MOND, to a new dark matter fluid, or to a full unification of forces?

There isn\u2019t a \u201csecret bypass,\u201d but there are legitimate ways to get endorsed even if you don\u2019t yet know anyone personally.\n\nHere are practical options that actually work:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Use arXiv\u2019s automatic endorsement system\n\nIn many categories, you don\u2019t need to know a person directly:\n\n1. Create an arXiv account and add your paper.\n2. When you try to submit in a category that requires endorsement, arXiv will:\n   - Tell you that you need an endorsement.\n   - Show you a link to the **endorsement system**.\n3. There you can:\n   - Request endorsement from *any* registered endorser in that category (they\u2019re listed by name).\n   - Or in some fields, endorsement can be granted automatically based on:\n     - Your previous submissions in related categories.\n     - Your publication record (if you link an institutional email or ORCID).\n\nYou do not have to know these endorsers personally. Many endorse based purely on the abstract and whether the paper looks like a serious submission.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Write a proper endorsement request email\n\nIf you\u2019re reaching out to potential endorsers:\n\n1. Go to the endorsement page for your category (arXiv will link you there).\n2. It will list endorsers with public email addresses or contact forms.\n3. Send a short, professional message, for example:\n\n> Subject: arXiv endorsement request for [category]  \n>  \n> Dear Dr. [Name],  \n>  \n> I am an independent researcher preparing to submit a manuscript to arXiv in [category]. The title is:  \n> \u201c[Title]\u201d  \n>  \n> Abstract:  \n> [Paste abstract, or a very short version]  \n>  \n> I would be grateful if you would consider endorsing my submission if you find it appropriate for arXiv. I understand you are busy and will of course accept your decision either way.  \n>  \n> Best regards,  \n> [Your Name]  \n> [Optional: link to a draft PDF or website]\n\nTips:\n- Keep it short, clear, and professional.\n- Make sure your PDF is well-typed (LaTeX or similar), with references and standard structure.\n- Don\u2019t argue your case; just present it.\n\nSome people won\u2019t reply; some will decline; you only need one yes.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Use the most \u201cappropriate\u201d category strategically\n\nSome categories are stricter than others. If your paper spans multiple fields:\n\n- Choose the **most standard / central** category where your work naturally fits.\n- Avoid highly restricted categories (like some in physics or CS) if your work also reasonably fits another that is easier to get endorsed in.\n- Do not miscategorize your paper just to slip through; arXiv moderators can reclassify or reject.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Leverage any weak institutional/contact ties you *do* have\n\nEven if you\u2019re not \u201cin academia,\u201d think broadly:\n\n- A professor from a past course.\n- A supervisor from a research internship or thesis.\n- A collaborator or coauthor who *is* at a university.\n- Someone whose seminar you attended and spoke to.\n\nYou can ask them specifically: \u201cWould you be willing to endorse my arXiv submission?\u201d They don\u2019t have to be in your exact subfield, only in the right arXiv category.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Join relevant online communities and ask there\n\nMany researchers are open to endorsing serious work by outsiders if:\n\n- The work is on-topic.\n- The PDF looks like a normal research paper.\n- You\u2019re not pushing fringe or crackpot material.\n\nPlaces to try (depending on your field):\n\n- Math: MathOverflow, category-specific mailing lists, or serious Discord/Slack groups.\n- CS: Relevant subreddits (e.g., r/MachineLearning, r/compsci), mailing lists, or lab/reading group discords.\n- Physics: Physics Stack Exchange (chat), specialized forums, etc.\n\nPost something like:\n\n> I\u2019m an independent researcher with a paper on [topic] aimed at arXiv category [X.YZ]. I need an endorser. Would anyone in this category be willing to look at the abstract and possibly endorse if it\u2019s appropriate?\n\nYou\u2019ll get ignored sometimes, but you only need one person.\n\n---\n\n## 6. As a last resort: contact arXiv support\n\nIf:\n- You have a serious, well-written paper.\n- You\u2019ve tried the automated system and reasonable outreach.\n- You still cannot get endorsed.\n\nThen write briefly to arXiv help (help@arxiv.org):\n\n- Explain that you\u2019re an independent researcher.\n- State the category and title of your paper.\n- Say you have been unable to find an endorser and ask if there\u2019s a recommended path.\n\nThey won\u2019t waive policies, but they sometimes clarify options or suggest categories.\n\n---\n\n## What *not* to do\n\n- Don\u2019t try to game the system with fake affiliations or pretending to know people.\n- Don\u2019t flood endorsers with spammy or argumentative emails.\n- Don\u2019t repeatedly resubmit rejected material or controversial \u201ctheory of everything\u201d\u2013type work; that\u2019s where people become very wary.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Your field (e.g., \u201calgebraic topology\u201d, \u201cML theory\u201d, \u201cquantum information\u201d), and\n- The rough topic of your paper,\n\nI can suggest:\n- A good arXiv category,\n- A short endorsement-request template tuned to that field, and\n- The likely type of person to contact first.",

Best arXiv categories for ML theory\n\nDepending on your paper, the most typical primary categories are:\n\n- **cs.LG \u2013 Machine Learning**  \n  General ML theory, optimization for ML, generalization bounds, PAC/online learning, etc.\n\n- **stat.ML \u2013 Machine Learning**  \n  More statistical angle: risk bounds, consistency, nonparametric methods, Bayesian learning, etc.\n\n- **cs.LG + stat.ML (cross-list)** is very common for theory papers.\n\nIf your work is especially close to one of these, you might use them instead:\n\n- **cs.LG + cs.LG** only (if purely CS-theory flavored ML, but not deep stats)\n- **cs.LG + cs.LG + cs.IT** if it has strong information-theoretic flavor  \n- **cs.LG + cs.DS** if it\u2019s more about algorithms and data structures for learning  \n- **stat.ML + math.ST** if it\u2019s mostly statistics with a learning application\n\nIf you tell me 1\u20132 sentences about what your paper actually proves (e.g., \u201cgeneralization bounds for overparameterized ReLU networks under X assumptions\u201d), I can suggest a more precise category combination.\n\n---\n\n### 2. How to use arXiv\u2019s endorsement system in ML\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Create an arXiv account** and start a submission in, say, `cs.LG`.\n2. When you reach the point where it says you need an endorsement, follow the **\u201cRequest endorsement\u201d** link.\n3. arXiv will show:\n   - Whether you might get *automatic* endorsement (e.g., if you have related prior submissions or a recognized email/ORCID).\n   - A list of **endorsers** for `cs.LG` (or whichever category). These are people who\u2019ve published there and are allowed to endorse.\n\nYou can then either:\n- Use the built-in \u201crequest endorsement\u201d mechanism (if available), or\n- Manually email one or more endorsers.\n\nYou do **not** have to know them personally.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Email template tailored for ML theory\n\nYou can adapt this:\n\n> Subject: arXiv endorsement request for cs.LG (machine learning theory)  \n>  \n> Dear Dr. [Last Name],  \n>  \n> I am an independent researcher preparing to submit a machine learning theory paper to arXiv in cs.LG (and possibly stat.ML as a cross\u2011list). The paper is titled:  \n> \u201c[Title]\u201d  \n>  \n> Abstract:  \n> [Paste abstract]  \n>  \n> The paper studies [1\u20132 sentences: e.g., \u201cgeneralization bounds for stochastic gradient descent on overparameterized neural networks under [assumptions], proving [main result in a phrase].\u201d]  \n>  \n> I would be very grateful if you would consider endorsing my submission if you find it suitable for arXiv in this category. I understand you are busy and fully understand if you prefer not to.  \n>  \n> Best regards,  \n> [Your Name]  \n> [Optional: link to draft PDF (Dropbox, personal site, etc.)]\n\nKey points for ML theory:\n\n- Make the abstract look like a normal theory paper:\n  - Clear problem statement.\n  - Main theorem(s) summarized.\n  - Brief mention of assumptions and setting.\n- Ensure the PDF is LaTeX-typed, with:\n  - Formal theorems/lemmas.\n  - Proof sketches or full proofs.\n  - Related work section with standard citations (NeurIPS, COLT, ICML, JMLR, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Who to contact (in practice)\n\nFor ML theory (cs.LG/stat.ML), good targets:\n\n- Authors of **recent ML theory papers** on topics close to yours (e.g., COLT, NeurIPS theory track, ALT, ITCS).\n- People who have multiple arXiv papers in `cs.LG` with theory flavor.\n- Often, assistant professors, postdocs, or senior PhD students are more responsive than very famous senior people.\n\nHow to find them:\n\n1. Search arXiv for recent `cs.LG` or `stat.ML` papers close to your topic.\n2. Click through to authors\u2019 homepages.\n3. Use their institutional email to send the short request above.\n\nYou may need to contact a few people; that\u2019s normal.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Using online communities\n\nFor ML theory specifically, you can also:\n\n- Post in a serious ML theory community (e.g., a theory-of-ML Slack/Discord, or a mailing list if you\u2019re on one) something like:\n\n  > I\u2019m an independent researcher with a theory paper aimed at arXiv cs.LG/stat.ML. I need an arXiv endorser. Would anyone with endorsement privileges in cs.LG/stat.ML be willing to look at my abstract and possibly endorse if it\u2019s appropriate?\n\nBe ready to share:\n- Title\n- Abstract\n- A link to the PDF.\n\n---\n\nIf you paste your abstract (or a sanitized version) and say which of the above categories you\u2019re leaning toward, I can:\n\n- Suggest the exact primary + cross-list categories.\n- Edit the endorsement-request email to sound maximally natural for ML theory.",

          "content": "Here\u2019s a concrete, step\u2011by\u2011step way to do it without already knowing anyone.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Start the submission so arXiv shows you the endorsement options\n\n1. Create / log into your arXiv account.\n2. Click \u201cSubmit\u201d and start a new submission.\n3. Fill in:\n   - Title, authors, abstract.\n   - Primary category: `cs.LG`\n   - Cross-list: `cs.AI` (you can add this later too).\n4. Upload your PDF (make sure it looks like a normal theory paper: LaTeX, theorems, proofs, references).\n\nWhen you reach the point where arXiv checks for endorsement, it will tell you that you need one and give you a **\u201cRequest endorsement\u201d** link.\n\nClick that. You\u2019ll see:\n\n- Whether you\u2019re eligible for *automatic* endorsement (often no, if this is your first ML paper).\n- A way to **request endorsement** from endorsers in `cs.LG`.\n\nFollow the on\u2011screen instructions and submit that request. Sometimes that\u2019s enough; an endorser may approve you without any extra emailing.\n\nBut to increase your chances, do the following in parallel.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Find potential endorsers in your area\n\nYou do *not* need to know them; they just need to be:\n\n- Active in `cs.LG` / RL theory.\n- Likely to be sympathetic to a serious independent submission.\n\nHow to find them:\n\n1. Go to https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/recent\n2. Search (browser find or arXiv search) for keywords like:\n   - \u201creinforcement learning\u201d\n   - \u201cmulti-agent\u201d\n   - \u201cconvergence\u201d\n3. Click on a few recent papers that look close to your topic.\n4. For each paper:\n   - Click the author names \u2192 usually there\u2019s a homepage or institutional page.\n   - Note the email address of one or two authors (postdocs / junior faculty / senior PhDs are often most responsive).\n\nYou now have a small list of people who:\n- Are in `cs.LG`,\n- Work on RL theory or related topics,\n- Are likely to be endorsers.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Send a short, focused endorsement request email\n\nSend to a few people (not a huge blast, but 3\u20136 is fine). Use something like this:\n\n> Subject: arXiv endorsement request for cs.LG (RL convergence theory)  \n>  \n> Dear Dr. [Last Name],  \n>  \n> I am an independent researcher preparing to submit a machine learning theory paper to arXiv in `cs.LG` (with cross\u2011list `cs.AI`). The paper studies convergence rates for reinforcement learning in multi\u2011agent settings.  \n>  \n> Title:  \n> [Your title]  \n>  \n> Abstract:  \n> [Paste your abstract]  \n>  \n> A draft PDF is available here:  \n> [Link to PDF \u2013 e.g., personal site, Dropbox, Google Drive with \u201canyone with the link can view\u201d]  \n>  \n> I would be very grateful if you would consider endorsing my submission if you find it appropriate for arXiv in this category. I understand you are busy and fully understand if you prefer not to.  \n>  \n> Best regards,  \n> [Your Name]  \n> [Optional: any brief credential, e.g., \u201cIndependent researcher with a background in X\u201d]\n\nNotes:\n\n- Keep it short and professional.\n- Don\u2019t oversell; let the abstract and PDF speak.\n- Send from a stable, real\u2011name email address.\n\nIf someone agrees, they can endorse you directly through arXiv (they know how; you don\u2019t need to explain it).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Make your paper look like something endorsers are comfortable backing\n\nEndorsers are mostly checking: \u201cIs this a serious, on\u2011topic paper, not spam or crank?\u201d\n\nFor ML theory / RL:\n\n- Structure:\n  - Introduction with clear problem statement and context.\n  - Preliminaries / setup.\n  - Main theorems (clearly stated).\n  - Proof sketches or full proofs.\n  - Related work (cite NeurIPS / ICML / COLT / JMLR etc. where relevant).\n  - Experiments are optional for pure theory, but fine if you have them.\n- Style:\n  - LaTeX, standard formatting.\n  - Clear notation.\n  - No grandiose claims like \u201cthis solves reinforcement learning\u201d or \u201crevolutionizes AI\u201d in the abstract/introduction.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure, compare your paper visually/structurally to a COLT or NeurIPS theory paper on arXiv and make yours look similar.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Use communities if you\u2019re comfortable doing so\n\nYou can also ask in serious ML/ML\u2011theory communities, for example:\n\n- A theory\u2011of\u2011ML Discord/Slack if you\u2019re in one.\n- A focused subreddit (e.g., r/MachineLearning) with a careful, non\u2011spammy post.\n\nExample text:\n\n> I\u2019m an independent researcher with a theory paper on convergence rates for multi\u2011agent reinforcement learning. I\u2019m trying to submit it to arXiv (`cs.LG` / `cs.AI`) but need an endorsement.  \n>  \n> Would anyone with endorsement rights in `cs.LG` be willing to look at my abstract (and draft PDF) and possibly endorse if it seems appropriate?  \n\nThen paste title + abstract + link.\n\nYou\u2019ll be ignored sometimes, but you only need one person.\n\n---\n\n## 6. If all else fails, contact arXiv support\n\nIf you\u2019ve:\n\n- Used the endorsement request system,\n- Emailed a reasonable number of people,\n- Tried for a week or two with no luck,\n\nyou can write to help@arxiv.org:\n\n- Explain you\u2019re an independent researcher.\n- State the category (`cs.LG` with cross\u2011list `cs.AI`), title, and that you\u2019ve been unable to obtain an endorsement.\n- Ask if there is any recommended path in your situation.\n\nThey won\u2019t just waive the rule, but they sometimes clarify options (e.g., alternative categories if appropriate, or checking if something about your account is blocking automatic endorsement).\n\n---\n\nIf you want, you can paste your abstract (remove anything you consider sensitive), and I can:\n\n- Tighten it so it looks more \u201cstandard\u201d to a cs.LG endorser.\n- Plug it directly into the email template, so you can send it as\u2011is.",

          "content": "You can absolutely share your work, but getting it into a form that professionals take seriously requires a few careful steps.\n\nBelow is a practical roadmap tailored to your situation (independent researcher, no formal medical training, aiming for arXiv and professional attention).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Reality check: what arXiv is and isn\u2019t\n\n- **arXiv is not peer review.** It\u2019s a preprint server. Uploading there makes your work visible, but does *not* validate it.\n- **Moderation exists.** In medicine-related categories, moderators screen for:\n  - Pseudoscience\n  - Dangerous medical claims\n  - Work that does not meet minimal scholarly standards\n- **Visibility to clinicians is limited.** Many clinicians read:\n  - PubMed-indexed journals\n  - medRxiv / bioRxiv\n  - Specialty society journals  \n  Far fewer browse arXiv for clinical insights.\n\nYou *can* still use arXiv, but you\u2019ll want to think strategically.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Choose the right venue\n\nFor medical/health content, consider:\n\n1. **medRxiv** (or bioRxiv if it\u2019s more basic science):\n   - Specifically for medical/biological sciences.\n   - Widely watched by researchers and clinicians.\n   - Has screening but is designed for exactly what you\u2019re doing: sharing preliminary research.\n\n2. **A small, specialty peer\u2011reviewed journal** (later step):\n   - After you polish your idea and maybe get feedback, aim for a journal that accepts:\n     - Hypothesis papers\n     - Narrative reviews\n     - Conceptual/position pieces\n\n3. **arXiv**:\n   - More common for quantitative / theoretical work (e.g., biostatistics, mathematical modeling, computational biology).\n   - If your work is mainly:\n     - Data analysis\n     - Modeling\n     - Statistical re-analysis of existing studies  \n     then a category like `q-bio`, `stat.ME` (methodology), or `cs.LG` (if ML) might be appropriate.\n\nWe can decide which fits best if you describe your idea and what kind of evidence you have (e.g., re-analysis of public datasets vs. literature synthesis vs. new clinical data).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Make your work look like a scientific paper\n\nProfessionals take things seriously when they look and behave like standard scientific work.\n\nTypical structure:\n\n1. **Title** \u2013 clear, specific, non-sensational.\n2. **Abstract (250\u2013300 words)** \u2013 Background, Methods, Results, Conclusion in 1 paragraph.\n3. **Introduction**\n   - What\u2019s known\n   - What\u2019s missing\n   - Your specific question or hypothesis\n4. **Methods**\n   - If you did:\n     - A **systematic or structured review**: describe search terms, databases, inclusion/exclusion criteria, how you extracted data.\n     - A **re-analysis of data**: describe datasets, preprocessing, statistical methods, software.\n   - Be explicit enough that someone else could replicate what you did.\n5. **Results**\n   - Present what you found, *not* your interpretation.\n   - Use tables/figures where helpful.\n6. **Discussion**\n   - Interpret your findings.\n   - Compare with existing literature.\n   - Acknowledge limitations (lack of formal training, observational nature, possible confounders, etc.).\n   - Suggest specific testable predictions or next studies.\n7. **Conclusion**\n   - Short, cautious, non-clinical.\n8. **References**\n   - Use a standard style (Vancouver, APA, etc.)\n   - Make sure every claim that isn\u2019t obvious is referenced.\n\nI can help you draft each section if you provide your idea and notes.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Stay within ethical and safety boundaries\n\nBecause this is health-related, be very careful:\n\n- **Do not give direct treatment recommendations** like:\n  - \u201cPatients should start taking X\u201d\n  - \u201cDoctors must stop prescribing Y\u201d\n- Instead, phrase as:\n  - \u201cThese findings suggest that X may be associated with Y and warrant further investigation in controlled clinical studies.\u201d\n- **Avoid personal medical advice** and case details that could identify individuals.\n- **Emphasize hypothesis and uncertainty.**  \n  Make it clear that:\n  - You are proposing a *hypothesis* or *model*\n  - It requires validation\n  - It is not a substitute for clinical judgment\n\nThis both improves your credibility and reduces the chance of being rejected by preprint moderators.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Address the \u201cno medical training\u201d issue constructively\n\nYou don\u2019t need a degree to publish, but you do need to:\n\n- **Demonstrate rigor:**\n  - Systematic approach\n  - Clear methods\n  - Balanced discussion of alternative explanations\n- **Be transparent:**\n  - State your background honestly in the acknowledgments or a brief note.\n- **Avoid overclaiming:**\n  - Don\u2019t say \u201cthis will revolutionize treatment.\u201d\n  - Do say \u201cif supported by future studies, this could have implications for\u2026\u201d\n\nIf possible, **collaborate**:\n\n- Find a sympathetic:\n  - Clinician\n  - Epidemiologist\n  - Biostatistician\n- Offer them co-authorship in exchange for:\n  - Methodological critique\n  - Help making language precise and clinically realistic\n\nEven one co-author with an institutional affiliation massively increases credibility and your chance of acceptance on medRxiv or in a journal.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Practical steps to get from idea to upload\n\n1. **Write a structured outline** of your paper:\n   - Bullet points under each heading (Intro, Methods, etc.).\n2. **Convert your reading into a methodologically sound approach**:\n   - If you mostly read \u201chundreds of papers,\u201d think:\n     - Can I turn this into a **structured narrative review**?\n     - Or a **systematic review-lite** (transparent search + selection criteria)?\n3. **Use a reference manager** (Zotero, Mendeley) to keep your citations organized.\n4. **Write a draft in Word/Google Docs first.**\n5. **Format for submission**:\n   - For arXiv: use LaTeX or their templates (I can help generate LaTeX if needed).\n   - For medRxiv: follow their formatting and section guidelines.\n6. **Get at least one critical reader**:\n   - Ideally someone with some scientific background.\n   - Ask them to specifically look for:\n     - Logical leaps\n     - Overstatements\n     - Missing references\n     - Unclear methods\n\n---\n\n## 7. How I can help you next\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste or describe:\n\n1. **Your core hypothesis** in 2\u20133 sentences.\n2. **What kind of evidence you have**:\n   - Literature only?\n   - Any data analysis?\n   - Any personal/clinical observations?\n3. **What outcome you ultimately hope for**:\n   - Clinicians to run a trial?\n   - Researchers to test a biomarker?\n   - Public health policy interest?\n\nThen I can:\n\n- Help you:\n  - Frame the hypothesis in scientific terms\n  - Decide the best preprint server / category\n  - Draft an abstract\n  - Outline the full paper tailored to your specific idea\n- Flag any claims that are likely to be rejected as unsafe or too speculative and help you rephrase them so they\u2019re acceptable but still clear.",

Don\u2019t worry about wording; I\u2019ll polish it.\n\nYou can literally copy these and type after each line:\n\n1. **Condition / topic:**  \n   (e.g., \u201cchronic fatigue in long COVID,\u201d \u201cmigraine in young adults,\u201d \u201ctype 2 diabetes complications,\u201d etc.)\n\n2. **Core connection / hypothesis (1\u20133 sentences):**  \n   (e.g., \u201cI think X symptom is often caused or worsened by Y mechanism/factor, which is under-recognized because Z.\u201d)\n\n3. **Type of work you did:**  \n   - Mainly: review of existing studies / re-analysis of datasets / new theoretical model / combination of these.\n\n4. **Methods (very briefly):**  \n   - Databases used: (e.g., PubMed, Google Scholar, others?)  \n   - About how many papers you *actually analyzed*: (e.g., ~25, ~60, etc.)  \n   - Any simple rules: (e.g., \u201chuman studies only, after 2000, English only, focused on adults,\u201d etc.)\n\n5. **Main findings (2\u20134 bullet points):**  \n   -  \n   -  \n   -  \n\n6. **Implications if you\u2019re right (1\u20133 sentences):**  \n   (e.g., \u201cIf this is correct, clinicians might need to screen for X in patients with Y,\u201d or \u201cThis could explain why some patients don\u2019t respond to current treatment Z,\u201d etc.)\n\n7. **Population / scope:**  \n   (e.g., \u201cadult outpatients,\u201d \u201cchildren with X,\u201d \u201cgeneral population,\u201d etc.)\n\nOnce you send even a rough version of those, I will:\n\n- Turn it into a polished, journal-style abstract (~200\u2013300 words).  \n- Use the standard structure (Background, Methods, Results, Conclusions).  \n- Keep the tone cautious, hypothesis-generating, and appropriate for a preprint server.\n\nWithout this information, any abstract I write would be generic and unusable for real submission. If you\u2019d prefer, you can also paste any rough notes or paragraphs you\u2019ve already written about your idea, and I\u2019ll extract what I need from that instead of making you answer each point.",

          "content": "You probably cannot use arXiv for this, and even if you could, it won\u2019t give you what you want in the way you\u2019re imagining.\n\nHere\u2019s how it actually works and what your realistic options are:\n\n### 1. arXiv is not a general self\u2011publishing platform\n\n- arXiv is for *research papers* in specific fields (physics, math, CS, etc.), not for full 200\u2011page books or monographs.\n- Submissions are screened by moderators. They don\u2019t do peer review, but they do:\n  - Check subject fit\n  - Filter out material they consider non\u2011scientific, crackpot, or outside community norms\n- A \u201ctheory of everything\u201d that explicitly \u201cchallenges mainstream science\u201d with no conventional technical framing will almost certainly be flagged or rejected.\n- If you are not already known to the community or don\u2019t have an endorser with arXiv credentials in the right category, you may not even get past the endorsement step.\n\nSo: uploading the whole 200\u2011page book as-is to arXiv is very unlikely to succeed.\n\n### 2. arXiv does not assign DOIs\n\n- arXiv gives you an **arXiv identifier** (e.g., arXiv:2401.01234), not a DOI.\n- You *can* cite arXiv preprints in many contexts, but they\u2019re not DOIs.\n- Some journals later assign DOIs to papers that also appear on arXiv, but that requires acceptance by a journal.\n\nIf your core need is \u201cI want a citable, persistent identifier,\u201d you don\u2019t need arXiv for that.\n\n### 3. Better ways to get a DOI for your book\n\nYou have several realistic routes:\n\n#### Option A: Zenodo (or a similar general repository)\n\n- Zenodo (zenodo.org) is a general-purpose research repository run by CERN/OpenAIRE.\n- You can upload:\n  - Books\n  - Preprints\n  - Data\n  - Any PDF\n- Zenodo **automatically assigns a DOI** to each upload.\n- You can then cite your work like any other DOI-based reference.\n- It\u2019s free, and you don\u2019t need to pass a scientific \u201cscreening\u201d the way you do with arXiv.\n\nFor your use case (self-published, lengthy, unconventional theory), Zenodo is almost certainly the most straightforward.\n\n#### Option B: Figshare, OSF, institutional repositories\n\n- **Figshare** and the **Open Science Framework (OSF)** also allow uploads and can assign DOIs.\n- Many universities have institutional repositories that assign DOIs to theses, reports, or books.\n\nThese work similarly to Zenodo in practice.\n\n#### Option C: Self-publishing platforms that support DOIs\n\n- Some academic self-publishing services or print-on-demand academic presses (e.g., some library-based presses, certain platforms via IngramSpark, etc.) can assign DOIs to books or chapters.\n- This takes more setup and sometimes money, but yields a more \u201cbook-like\u201d published object (ISBN + DOI).\n\n### 4. If you still want to try arXiv\n\nIf you\u2019re determined to try arXiv anyway, your best chance is:\n\n- **Condense** your 200-page book into a research-article-style paper (e.g., 20\u201340 pages) with:\n  - Clear abstract\n  - Standard structure (introduction, methods, results, discussion)\n  - References to existing literature\n  - Technical, not polemical, tone\n- Submit it under an appropriate category (e.g., general relativity and quantum cosmology, high-energy theory, etc., if it\u2019s physics).\n- You may need an **endorser**: someone with an arXiv account who can vouch that your submission is appropriate for that category.\n- Even then, moderators may reject it if they judge it outside the scientific scope.\n\nAnd again: even if accepted, arXiv will not give you a DOI, only an arXiv ID.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- Uploading your 200-page \u201ctheory of everything\u201d book directly to arXiv is very unlikely to work, and arXiv does not give DOIs anyway.\n- If your main goal is \u201ca persistent, citable identifier so I can cite myself,\u201d use **Zenodo** (or Figshare/OSF/etc.), which:\n  - Accepts full books\n  - Automatically assigns a **DOI**\n  - Is widely recognized and citable\n\nIf you want, I can outline step-by-step how to prepare your PDF and metadata for Zenodo so it looks as professional and \u201cacademic\u201d as possible.",

Prepare your manuscript as a PDF\n\n1. **Finalize the content**\n   - Make sure the text is in its \u201cbook\u201d form: front matter, chapters, references, appendices.\n   - No need for a publisher logo; you\u2019re the publisher.\n\n2. **Add basic book front matter**\n   At minimum:\n   - Title page (title, your name, year)\n   - Optional: version number (e.g., \u201cVersion 1.0, January 2026\u201d)\n   - Optional: short subtitle\n   - Optional: a one\u2011paragraph abstract/summary on its own page\n\n3. **Add your name clearly**\n   - Use your full name as you want it to appear in citations.\n   - If you have an ORCID, you can include it on the title page (e.g., \u201cORCID: 0000\u20110002\u2011\u2026\u201d) \u2013 useful but not required.\n\n4. **Export to PDF**\n   - Use a standard page size (A4 or US Letter).\n   - Ensure:\n     - All fonts are embedded.\n     - No password protection.\n     - The file opens correctly in a normal PDF viewer.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Create a Zenodo account\n\n1. Go to: **https://zenodo.org/**\n2. Click **Sign up** (top right).\n3. You can:\n   - Sign up with email/password, or\n   - Use a GitHub/ORCID login.\n\n4. Confirm your email address if they send a verification mail.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Start a new upload\n\n1. Once logged in, click **Upload** (usually top right).\n2. Click **New upload** (if given a choice).\n\nYou\u2019ll see a form with multiple sections (Upload type, Basic information, Creators, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Choose \u201cUpload type\u201d and \u201cPublication type\u201d\n\nFor a book:\n\n1. **Upload type**: choose **Publication**.\n2. **Publication type**: choose **Book** or **Report** (whichever fits better; \u201cBook\u201d is probably what you want).\n\nThis tells Zenodo how to classify it.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Fill in the metadata fields\n\nThese fields are important because they control how your work is indexed and cited.\n\n### A. Basic information\n\n- **Title**: Use your full book title.\n- **Subtitle** (optional): If you have one, put it here.\n- **Publication date**: Use the year/month/day you\u2019re uploading or your preferred \u201cbook publication\u201d date.\n- **Description**: This is your abstract/summary.\n  - 1\u20133 paragraphs explaining:\n    - What the book is about.\n    - The main idea of your theory.\n    - The structure (e.g., \u201cThe book is organized into X chapters\u2026\u201d).\n\n- **Keywords**: Add 3\u201310 relevant terms, e.g.:\n  - \u201ctheory of everything\u201d\n  - \u201cfundamental physics\u201d\n  - \u201cunified field theory\u201d\n  - \u201cfoundations of physics\u201d\n  - \u201ccosmology\u201d\n  - \u201cquantum gravity\u201d\n  etc.\n\n### B. Creators (authors)\n\n- Click **Add creator**.\n- Enter:\n  - **Name**: Your full name.\n  - **Affiliation**: Your institution or \u201cIndependent researcher\u201d.\n  - **ORCID** (optional but recommended if you have one).\n\nIf there are multiple authors, add them all.\n\n### C. Contributors (optional)\n\n- You can list editors, illustrators, or others who helped, but this isn\u2019t required.\n\n### D. License\n\nChoose how others may use your book. Common choices:\n\n- **CC BY 4.0** (Creative Commons Attribution):\n  - Others can use, share, and adapt your work as long as they credit you.\n- **CC BY-NC 4.0**:\n  - Same, but non\u2011commercial only.\n- **CC BY-ND 4.0**:\n  - They can share but not modify.\n- Or **\u201cAll rights reserved\u201d** if you don\u2019t want to grant any reuse rights beyond normal citation.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure and want people to be able to read and cite but not republish commercially, **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0** is a conservative choice.\n\n### E. Version\n\n- Put something like **\u201c1.0\u201d**.\n- If you later upload a revised edition, you can mark it as version 2.0, etc.\n\n### F. Language\n\n- Select the language of the book (e.g., English).\n\n### G. Related identifiers (optional but useful)\n\nIf you later publish a revised version or a related paper, you can link them here. For now you can leave this blank.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Upload the PDF file\n\n1. At the top of the form, there\u2019s an **Upload files** section.\n2. Drag and drop your PDF or click **Choose files** and select it.\n3. Wait until the upload completes (you\u2019ll see a progress bar).\n\nYou can optionally rename the file (e.g., `Lastname-2026-TheoryOfEverything.pdf`).\n\n---\n\n## 7. Choose \u201cCommunity\u201d (optional)\n\nZenodo has \u201ccommunities\u201d (topic groupings). This is optional, but can help visibility.\n\n- Click **Communities** and search for something like:\n  - \u201cPhysics\u201d\n  - \u201cTheoretical physics\u201d\n  - \u201cOpen science\u201d\n- If you find a relevant community that accepts general theoretical work, you can request inclusion. If not, skip this step.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Save, preview, and publish\n\n1. Click **Save** to store your draft.\n2. Review:\n   - Title\n   - Authors\n   - Description\n   - License\n   - File\n3. When satisfied, click **Publish**.\n\nZenodo will then:\n\n- Finalize the record.\n- Assign a **DOI** (e.g., `10.5281/zenodo.1234567`).\n\nThe DOI appears on the record page after publishing.\n\n---\n\n## 9. How to cite yourself using the Zenodo DOI\n\nZenodo gives you citation formats, but you can also write them manually. For example, in a reference list:\n\n**APA-like:**\n\nYourLastName, YourInitials. (2026). *Title of Your Book: Subtitle if any* (Version 1.0). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1234567\n\n**BibTeX example:**\n\n```bibtex\n@book{YourLastName2026,\n  author    = {YourLastName, YourFirstName},\n  title     = {Title of Your Book: Subtitle if any},\n  year      = {2026},\n  publisher = {Zenodo},\n  version   = {1.0},\n  doi       = {10.5281/zenodo.1234567},\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1234567}\n}\n```\n\nYou can then cite this DOI in future papers, manuscripts, or later versions of your work.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Updating later (new editions)\n\nIf you revise the book:\n\n1. Go to your Zenodo record.\n2. Click **New version**.\n3. Upload the new PDF and adjust metadata (e.g., Version 2.0, new date).\n4. Publish the new version.\n\nZenodo will:\n\n- Keep the **same \u201cconcept DOI\u201d** for the work as a whole.\n- Assign a **new DOI** for the specific version.\n- Show a clear link between versions.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste a working title and a short abstract here, and I can help you draft clean metadata text (title, description, keywords) tailored for Zenodo.",

Starting from the observation that both general relativity and quantum theory can be expressed in fundamentally geometric terms, the work proposes a common geometric structure within which classical spacetime curvature and quantum behavior arise as different manifestations of the same underlying framework.\n\nThe exposition begins with a critical review of the standard formulations of quantum mechanics and general relativity, emphasizing their geometric content and the tensions between them. It then introduces a generalized geometric setting (including [replace with your actual structures: e.g., extended manifolds, fiber bundles, non\u2011Riemannian geometry, etc.]) and derives dynamical equations that reduce to familiar quantum and gravitational equations in appropriate limits. Within this framework, quantum phenomena are interpreted as [e.g., geometric phases, curvature in an abstract configuration space, or fluctuations in a higher\u2011dimensional structure], while gravitational effects correspond to [e.g., emergent curvature of an effective spacetime].\n\nThe presentation is technical but designed to be accessible to readers with a background in theoretical physics or applied mathematics. Detailed derivations, worked examples, and comparisons with existing approaches to quantum gravity are provided, along with a discussion of conceptual implications, potential observational consequences, and open problems. The goal is not only to propose a specific unifying model, but also to illustrate how geometric thinking can guide the search for a consistent quantum\u2013gravitational theory.\n\n---\n\nYou should customize the bracketed parts (and any wording) to match your actual construction and emphasis.\n\n### Suggested keywords\n\nYou can list these as Zenodo \u201ckeywords\u201d:\n\n- quantum gravity  \n- geometric unification  \n- unified field theory  \n- quantum mechanics  \n- general relativity  \n- theoretical physics  \n- geometric methods in physics  \n- foundations of physics  \n- spacetime geometry  \n\n### Citation templates (fill in year and DOI later)\n\n**APA-style (example):**\n\nYourLastName, YourInitials.

Before formatting: basic reality check\n\nP vs NP is extremely deep; any claimed proof will be met with extreme skepticism. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re wrong, but it does mean:\n\n- You must present it in absolutely standard, professional form.\n- You should expect people to look for a *local* error (a specific step that fails), not to \u201cbelieve the big idea.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why good structure and notation are crucial.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Overall structure of the paper\n\nFor a 50\u2011page proof, a typical structure:\n\n1. **Title and author**\n2. **Abstract** (\u2264 1/2 page)\n3. **Introduction**\n   - Background on P vs NP\n   - Informal overview of your approach\n   - Main theorem statement (e.g., \u201cWe prove P = NP.\u201d) with precise formulation\n   - Comparison to related approaches, if any\n4. **Preliminaries and notation**\n   - Definitions of P, NP, decision problems, reductions, etc., in standard form\n   - Any nonstandard definitions you use\n5. **High-level strategy of the proof**\n   - A roadmap: \u201cSection 4 constructs\u2026, Section 5 shows\u2026, Combining\u2026\u201d\n6. **Core technical sections**\n   - Break your proof into lemmas and propositions\n   - Each lemma has a clear statement and proof\n7. **Main theorem**\n   - Final assembly: \u201cProof of Theorem 1.1.\u201d\n8. **Discussion / limitations / open questions**\n9. **References**\n\nIf you paste or describe your current section organization, I can help you reorganize it into this template.\n\n---\n\n## 3. LaTeX template for arXiv\n\narXiv strongly prefers LaTeX.

I can help generate entries if you list the papers/books you cite.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Converting your 50\u2011page draft to LaTeX\n\nDepending on your current format:\n\n### If it\u2019s in Word / Google Docs\n1. Export as plain text or copy/paste into a `.tex` file.\n2. Replace:\n   - Section titles with `\\section{...}`, `\\subsection{...}`\n   - Inline math: wrap in `$...$`\n   - Displayed equations: `\\begin{equation} ... \\end{equation}` or `\\[ ... \\]`\n3. Turn statements into theorem environments:\n   - \u201cLemma 3.2.\u201d \u2192 `\\begin{lemma}\\label{lem:xyz} ... \\end{lemma}`\n   - \u201cProof.\u201d \u2192 `\\begin{proof} ... \\end{proof}`\n\nIf you show me a representative page (or paste a chunk), I can give you specific LaTeX translations and patterns you can reuse.\n\n### If it\u2019s handwritten\nYou\u2019ll have to type it. While you\u2019re typing:\n- Standardize notation early.\n- Use macros for recurring objects (e.g. `\\SAT` for SAT).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Making it readable (critical for credibility)\n\nFor a claim like P = NP, reviewers and readers will look immediately for:\n\n- **Clear statement of the problem**: Use standard definitions from any textbook (Sipser, Arora\u2013Barak).\n- **Identification of where you use nontrivial ideas**: Put them in named lemmas or propositions.\n- **No hidden assumptions**: E.g., you must not implicitly assume something like \u201call Boolean formulas have some special structure\u201d that is false in general.\n\nTry to ensure:\n\n- Every lemma\u2019s statement is unambiguous and *general* (no hidden conditions that only hold for special inputs).\n- Every proof step is justified either by a previous lemma, a definition, or a standard theorem (which you reference).\n\nIf you want, paste the statement of your main construction or key lemma, and I can help you rewrite it in standard mathematical style.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Getting it onto arXiv if you lack an endorser\n\narXiv requires either:\n\n- Direct submission rights (if you have an institutional email or prior submissions), or\n- An **endorser** in the relevant category (here: cs.CC or cs.CC / math.LO, etc.).\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Create an arXiv account** at https://arxiv.org\n2. Try to submit to a category like `cs.CC` (Computational Complexity) or `cs.DS` (if relevant).\n3. If you\u2019re blocked by the endorsement system:\n   - Go to the endorsement page arXiv links you to.\n   - Search for endorsers in `cs.CC`.\n   - Many endorsers are cautious about P vs NP claims; to have a chance:\n     - Make your title and abstract professional and modest in tone.\n     - Emphasize that you welcome error reports and that the paper is self-contained.\n4. **Alternative immediate timestamping** if endorsement is slow:\n   - Upload the PDF to a site with a clear timestamp (e.g., Zenodo, OSF, or even a permanent GitHub repo).\n   - Zenodo/OSF will give you a DOI and a date, which is recognized as a public disclosure.\n   - Then, in your arXiv submission request/endorsement request, you can link that version.\n\nIf you want, I can help you draft a short, professional email/message to potential endorsers.\n\n---\n\n## 7. What I can do next with you\n\nIf you\u2019re comfortable sharing:\n\n- Paste your **abstract** and **section headings**; I\u2019ll:\n  - Restructure them into a standard form.\n  - Suggest a better title and arXiv category.\n- Paste a **critical lemma and its proof**; I\u2019ll:\n  - Help format it in LaTeX.\n  - Flag any obvious logical/complexity-theoretic issues, so you don\u2019t upload something with an immediate, fatal flaw.\n\nTell me:\n1. What format your current draft is in (Word, PDF, handwritten, etc.).\n2.

          "content": "For machine learning, you can absolutely submit as an independent researcher using a personal email. The key parts are: picking the right category and handling endorsement (if needed).\n\nHere\u2019s a concrete step\u2011by\u2011step:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Create your arXiv account\n\n1. Go to: https://arxiv.org/user/register\n2. Use your personal email (Gmail, Proton, etc.).\n3. Fill in:\n   - Your real name\n   - Affiliation: you can write something like:\n     - \u201cIndependent researcher\u201d or\n     - \u201cUnaffiliated\u201d\n4. Confirm your email.\n\nYou do *not* need a university email.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Choose the right category for ML\n\nMost ML papers go into one of:\n\n- **cs.LG** \u2013 Learning (Computer Science)  \n  (This is the main ML category.)\n- **stat.ML** \u2013 Machine Learning (Statistics)  \n  (Often for more statistical / theoretical ML.)\n- **cs.AI** \u2013 Artificial Intelligence  \n  (Sometimes used if the work is more symbolic AI or general AI, not core ML.)\n\nYou can choose a **primary** category and additional **secondary** ones. Typical combinations:\n\n- Deep learning / general ML:  \n  - Primary: `cs.LG`  \n  - Secondary: `stat.ML` (optional)\n- More statistical / theory-heavy ML:  \n  - Primary: `stat.ML`  \n  - Secondary: `cs.LG`\n- RL or planning-heavy with AI flavor:  \n  - Primary: `cs.LG` or `cs.AI`  \n  - Secondary: the other one\n\nIf you tell me what your paper is about (one sentence), I can suggest an exact category combo.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Endorsement for ML categories\n\nMany CS/ML categories require endorsement for *new* submitters, especially `cs.LG` and `stat.ML`.\n\n### How to check and request endorsement\n\n1. After logging in, go to \u201cSubmit\u201d and start a new submission.\n2. When you pick your primary category (e.g., `cs.LG`), if endorsement is required, arXiv will:\n   - Show a message, and\n   - Give you a link to request an endorsement.\n\n3. On the endorsement page, you\u2019ll see:\n   - A list of potential endorsers, or\n   - A form to send an endorsement request.\n\nThe system is designed for people like you\u2014independent researchers\u2014so this is normal.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How to actually get endorsed\n\nYou have a few realistic paths:\n\n### A. Use arXiv\u2019s automatic endorser suggestion\n\nWhen you request endorsement:\n- arXiv may list people who are active in that category and somehow \u201cnear\u201d you (e.g., same email domain or past associations).\n- You can send a short, professional message through the system.\n\nWhat to include in the message:\n- A 2\u20133 sentence description of your paper.\n- A link to a PDF (e.g., Google Drive, personal site, GitHub) so they can skim it.\n- A brief note that you\u2019re an independent researcher and that you\u2019ll only submit appropriate work.\n\nExample text (you can adapt):\n\n> I\u2019m an independent researcher working in machine learning. I\u2019d like to submit a paper titled \u201c...\u201d to the cs.LG category and need an endorsement. The paper studies ... (2\u20133 sentences).  \n>  \n> You can view the current version here: [link].  \n>  \n> If you feel it\u2019s appropriate for cs.LG, I\u2019d be grateful if you could endorse me. If not, no worries and thank you for your time.\n\nKeep it short and professional.\n\n---\n\n### B. Ask someone you already know\n\nIf you have any of the following:\n- Former supervisor, teacher, or collaborator\n- Someone you\u2019ve corresponded with about your work\n- Someone you interacted with at a workshop, meetup, or online research community\n\nYou can:\n1. Check if they have published in `cs.LG` or `stat.ML` on arXiv (search their name).\n2. Email them directly with:\n   - Your paper PDF or link\n   - A short explanation and the category you want\n   - A request for endorsement\n\nThey can then log into arXiv and endorse you.\n\n---\n\n### C. If you don\u2019t know anyone\n\nThen lean on:\n- The built\u2011in endorsement request system.\n- Possibly contacting authors whose work you cite and that is close to yours:\n  - Look up their arXiv profile.\n  - Email them politely, with your paper and a short explanation.\n\nThe main thing endorsers care about:\n- The paper is on-topic for the category.\n- It is written in a reasonably clear, scientific style.\n- It\u2019s not spam or clearly unscientific.\n\nIt does **not** need to be \u201cperfect\u201d or guaranteed publishable.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Prepare your submission\n\nTo maximize your chances of a smooth endorsement and submission:\n\n- Format:\n  - Use LaTeX if possible (standard in ML).\n  - Or a clean PDF with all fonts embedded.\n- Include:\n  - Title, authors, affiliation (\u201cIndependent researcher\u201d is fine),\n  - Abstract,\n  - Clear sections, references.\n- Make sure:\n  - No obvious typos in the title/abstract.\n  - No placeholder sections (\u201cTODO\u201d, etc.).\n  - No plagiarism.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Finish the submission\n\nOnce endorsed:\n\n1. Upload your source (LaTeX + figures) or PDF.\n2. Fill in:\n   - Title\n   - Authors\n   - Abstract\n   - Primary and secondary categories\n   - Comments (e.g., \u201cUnder review at ...\u201d if true)\n3. Confirm the license.\n4. Submit and wait for moderation (usually 1\u20132 days).\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste:\n- Your paper title,\n- Abstract,\n- One-sentence description of the main contribution,\n\nand I can:\n- Suggest the best primary/secondary categories,\n- Help you draft a short endorsement request message tailored to your paper.",

A tailored paper structure for \u201cnew approach to entanglement\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a generic skeleton we can adapt once I see your specifics:\n\n1. **Title**  \n   Something like:  \n   - \u201cA [Conceptual/Operational] Reformulation of Quantum Entanglement\u201d  \n   - \u201cReinterpreting Quantum Entanglement via [Your Key Idea]\u201d\n\n2. **Abstract (\u2248150\u2013250 words)**  \n   - 1\u20132 sentences: What problem or confusion about entanglement you address.  \n   - 1\u20132 sentences: What your new approach is.  \n   - 1\u20132 sentences: Main consequences or insights.\n\n3. **1. Introduction**  \n   - Briefly explain entanglement and why it\u2019s puzzling/important.  \n   - Mention standard issues (nonlocal correlations, Bell\u2019s theorem, etc.).  \n   - State what is unsatisfying or incomplete about existing views.  \n   - State your proposal in plain language.  \n   - Outline what the paper will do.\n\n4. **2. Background**  \n   - Minimal math setup: states, tensor products, reduced density matrices, etc.  \n   - Standard view of entanglement (e.g., definition, Bell states, Bell inequalities).  \n   - Any interpretations you rely on or contrast with (Copenhagen, Many-Worlds, etc.).  \n   - Make clear what you *accept* from standard QM and what you *challenge*.\n\n5. **3. Formulation of the New Approach**  \n   - Precise statement of your core idea.  \n   - Definitions: any new terms or reinterpretations.  \n   - Mathematical or logical formulation:  \n     - E.g., how you represent entangled states, measurements, correlations.  \n   - Apply it to a simple example (e.g., singlet state of two spins).\n\n6. **4. Consequences and Comparison with Standard View**  \n   - Show how your approach explains:  \n     - Correlations in Bell-type experiments.  \n     - No-signalling (or explain if you modify it).  \n   - Compare predictions:  \n     - If predictions are the same as standard QM, emphasize conceptual clarity.  \n     - If predictions differ, say *exactly where* and *how*.\n\n7. **5. Discussion and Limitations**  \n   - What your approach clarifies or solves (e.g., some paradox, confusion).  \n   - What it doesn\u2019t address (e.g., full measurement problem, relativistic QFT, etc.).  \n   - Possible criticisms or open questions.\n\n8. **6. Conclusion**  \n   - Restate the main idea and its significance.  \n   - Briefly mention possible future work or tests.\n\n9. **References**  \n   - At minimum, you\u2019ll want to cite some standard entanglement and Bell\u2019s theorem references.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

To turn this into a paper-level idea, we need to make \u201cjust correlated information\u201d precise and show how it differs from what people already say.\n\nLet\u2019s go step by step.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Clarify your idea a bit more\n\nPlease answer these briefly (rough is fine):\n\n1. When you say \u201cjust correlated information,\u201d do you mean:\n   - (a) Entanglement is nothing more than classical correlations we don\u2019t fully know yet (hidden variables), or  \n   - (b) Entanglement is *still quantum*, but what\u2019s fundamental is the information structure, not particles/fields, or  \n   - (c) Something else?\n\n2. In your view, is there anything *special* about quantum entanglement compared to classical correlations? For example:\n   - Does your approach explain why Bell inequalities are violated?\n   - Or do you think Bell\u2019s theorem is misunderstood / misapplied?\n\n3. Do you use any math in your notes?\n   - Dirac notation like \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\), \\(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle\\), etc.?\n   - Density matrices, probabilities, or just words?\n\n4. Do you have a specific example you like?\n   - EPR pair (two spins in a singlet state)?\n   - Polarization of entangled photons?\n   - Something like: \u201cIf Alice measures spin up, Bob\u2019s result is constrained because the information was already in the pair\u201d?\n\nIf you answer those, I can tailor the structure better and start drafting sections.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What\u2019s already close to your idea (important for \u201cnewness\u201d)\n\nMany researchers already say things like:\n- \u201cEntanglement is non-classical correlations between subsystems.\u201d\n- \u201cEntanglement is about information that cannot be localized.\u201d\n- \u201cQuantum theory is fundamentally about information (quantum information / QBism / relational QM, etc.).\u201d\n\nSo for your idea to be genuinely *new* (and not just a rephrasing), we need to see:\n\n- Do you **reduce** entanglement to *classical* information (hidden variables)?  \n- Or do you **reinterpret** quantum information in some specific way (e.g., as constraints, bookkeeping, relational facts, etc.)?\n- Do you **deny** that there is \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d? If so, *how* do you avoid Bell\u2019s theorem?\n\nDon\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know all the technical literature; I just need your honest view.\n\n---\n\n## 3. A provisional paper outline based on your claim\n\nHere\u2019s a concrete structure we can start filling in. I\u2019ll assume your view is:\n\n> Entanglement is best understood as correlated information between systems, with no mysterious nonlocal influence; the weirdness comes from how quantum information is structured, not from any physical \u201cinstantaneous action.\u201d\n\nWe can adjust once you clarify.\n\n### Title (draft)\n\n- \u201cQuantum Entanglement as Correlated Information\u201d\n- or more modestly:\n- \u201cA Correlated-Information Perspective on Quantum Entanglement\u201d\n\n### Abstract (very rough draft)\n\nYou\u2019ll eventually want something like:\n\n> Quantum entanglement is usually described as a nonlocal correlation between distant systems that defies classical explanation. In this work I propose that entanglement can be understood more simply as correlated information shared between subsystems, without invoking any mysterious instantaneous influence. I analyze standard entangled states, such as the Bell states, in terms of information constraints on measurement outcomes and show how this picture reproduces the usual quantum predictions. I discuss the relationship between this view and classical correlations, and clarify in what sense quantum entanglement still differs from purely classical shared information. This perspective aims to demystify entanglement by emphasizing its informational content rather than ontological puzzles about distant objects.\n\nWe\u2019ll refine once your idea is clearer.\n\n### Section 1 \u2013 Introduction (what we\u2019ll build)\n\nKey points to include:\n- Entanglement is central and puzzling.\n- Usual story: \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d.\n- Your proposal: reframe entanglement as correlated information.\n- What you do in the paper (conceptual + simple examples).\n\n### Section 2 \u2013 Standard view in minimal math\n\nHere you\u2019d briefly recall:\n- Qubits and composite systems.\n- Example: Bell state \\(|\\Phi^+\\rangle = (|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}\\).\n- How measurement outcomes are correlated.\n- What people usually say about \u201cnonlocality\u201d.\n\n### Section 3 \u2013 Correlated-information formulation (your core idea)\n\nThis is where we need your input. We\u2019d try to:\n\n1. Define what you mean by \u201cinformation\u201d:\n   - Shannon-like? (bits, probabilities)\n   - Or more informal: \u201cknowledge about possible outcomes\u201d?\n\n2. Show, with a simple example:\n   - Before measurement, the *pair* encodes a constraint like \u201cthe two results will be the same\u201d (or opposite, depending on the state).\n   - Measurement reveals one side; the other is then fixed by the shared information, not by a new influence.\n\n3. Explain what is *quantum* about it:\n   - Superposition of correlations?\n   - Inability to assign definite local values that respect all constraints (Bell-type arguments)?\n\n### Section 4 \u2013 Comparison with classical correlations\n\n- Show how classical correlated bits (e.g., two coins prepared to always be equal) are similar and where they differ.\n- Address Bell\u2019s theorem:\n  - Do you accept that no local hidden-variable model reproduces all quantum predictions?\n  - If yes, explain that your \u201cinformation\u201d is still quantum (not classical hidden variables).\n  - If no, explain where you think the usual argument goes wrong.\n\n### Section 5 \u2013 Discussion and limitations\n\n- What your perspective clarifies (e.g., language about \u201cspooky action\u201d).\n- What it does *not* change (e.g., the actual experimental predictions).\n- Open questions.\n\n### Section 6 \u2013 Conclusion\n\n- Restate the main idea.\n- Possible future work (e.g., formalizing the information-theoretic part, applying to more complex systems).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Let\u2019s draft some actual text together\n\nTo move from outline to real content, do this:\n\n1. Write 1\u20132 paragraphs in your own words starting with:\n   - \u201cIn my view, entanglement is just correlated information because\u2026\u201d\n   - \u201cConsider two entangled particles.

Make it *look* like standard professional work so people will actually read it.\n\nBoth matter. Here\u2019s how to approach it.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understand the arXiv gatekeeping\n\narXiv has:\n- **Moderators**: They check basic relevance and minimal standards.\n- **Endorsement system**: In many categories, a current arXiv author must endorse you before you can submit.\n\nYou need:\n- A paper that looks and reads like normal research.\n- Someone (often a faculty member or independent researcher) who\u2019s willing to endorse you.\n\nYou don\u2019t need institutional affiliation, but you *do* need your work to look serious and conventional.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Use standard LaTeX structure and style\n\nWrite the paper in LaTeX, using the standard `article` class or the arXiv template. Basic skeleton:\n\n```tex\n\\documentclass[11pt]{article}\n\\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,amsthm}\n\\usepackage{hyperref}\n\n\\title{[Concise, neutral, technical title]}\n\\author{Your Name \\\\ \\small Independent researcher}\n\\date{\\today}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\maketitle\n\n\\begin{abstract}\nWe [state clearly what you do].

Title, abstract, and tone: avoid red flags\n\n**Title**:\n- Avoid: \u201cA Proof That Modern Physics Is Wrong\u201d\n- Prefer: \u201cOn [Specific Mathematical Structure] and Its Implications for [Specific Area of Physics]\u201d\n\n**Abstract**:\n- 1\u20132 short paragraphs.\n- State:\n  - What object you study.\n  - What you prove (clearly framed as theorems).\n  - Any implications very cautiously.\n- Avoid grand claims, emotional language, or attacks on \u201cmainstream science\u201d.\n\n**Tone throughout**:\n- No rhetoric about \u201cestablishment\u201d, \u201cdogma\u201d, \u201crevolutionary theory\u201d, etc.\n- Don\u2019t say \u201cI prove that quantum mechanics is false.\u201d\n- Say \u201cWe show that under assumptions A, B, C, the standard formalism leads to X, which appears to be in tension with Y. We discuss possible interpretations.\u201d\n\nProfessional writing is:\n- Understated\n- Precise\n- Very careful about what is *proved* vs what is *speculated*\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mathematical standards: what professionals look for\n\nTo be taken seriously, your paper must:\n\n1. **State clear assumptions**  \n   - List them explicitly.\n   - Don\u2019t hide controversial assumptions; highlight them.\n\n2. **Use standard definitions and notation**  \n   - Follow textbooks and well-cited papers.\n   - If you change notation, say so and explain it.\n\n3. **Structure proofs cleanly**  \n   - Theorem \u2192 Proof \u2192 QED.\n   - Each step justified either by:\n     - A previous lemma/theorem.\n     - A standard result (with a citation).\n     - A calculation you show.\n\n4. **Separate math from interpretation**  \n   - Math sections: pure derivations and proofs.\n   - Physics/interpretation section: what the results *might* mean, including alternative explanations and limitations.\n\nIf your work \u201cshows problems with current physics\u201d, you should:\n- First prove a *mathematical* inconsistency or constraint.\n- Then show that standard physics, under specific assumptions, violates that constraint.\n- Explicitly list those assumptions and discuss whether they are actually accepted in physics.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Formatting and presentation details\n\n- **Length**: 10\u201330 pages is typical. Under ~6 pages often looks too thin; over 40 pages invites skepticism unless it\u2019s clearly very structured.\n- **Figures**: Use only if they clarify something; make them simple and labeled.\n- **Spelling/grammar**: Run a grammar checker; ask a fluent speaker to proofread if possible.\n- **Sectioning**:\n  - 1. Introduction\n  - 2. Background / Preliminaries\n  - 3. Main Results\n  - 4. Examples / Applications\n  - 5. Discussion / Conclusion\n- **References**:\n  - Cite standard textbooks and key papers in the exact area you\u2019re touching.\n  - Show you know what\u2019s already been done.\n  - Avoid only citing popular-science books or random websites.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Getting an arXiv endorsement as an outsider\n\nSteps you can take:\n\n1. **Put the paper on a personal site or GitHub**  \n   - PDF + source code (LaTeX).\n   - Short, neutral description.\n\n2. **Contact potential endorsers**:\n   - Look up researchers who publish in the arXiv category you\u2019re targeting.\n   - Send a *very short* email:\n     - 2\u20133 sentences about what the paper is about.\n     - 1 sentence about your background (\u201cindependent, self-taught; I know this is unusual\u201d is fine).\n     - A link to the PDF.\n     - Explicitly ask: \u201cWould you be willing to look at this and, if you find it meets basic standards, endorse me for arXiv submission?\u201d\n   - Do *not* claim to have overthrown physics in the email.\n\n3. **Be ready for silence or rejection**  \n   - Many people will ignore it; that\u2019s normal.\n   - Improve the paper and try again with someone else, maybe after feedback from online math/physics forums (if you can get serious critique).\n\n---\n\n## 7. Avoid common \u201coutsider\u201d pitfalls\n\nThese are instant red flags for moderators and readers:\n\n- Overstated claims: \u201cfinal theory\u201d, \u201cdisproves relativity\u201d, \u201cshows all of physics is wrong\u201d.\n- No clear theorems, no proofs, just long calculations and rhetoric.\n- Mixing philosophy, personal stories, or complaints about academia into the paper.\n- Ignoring well-known no-go theorems or experimental results that contradict your claims, without addressing them explicitly.\n- Using nonstandard definitions without clearly saying so.\n\nReplace:\n- \u201cI discovered that all of quantum field theory is inconsistent.\u201d\nwith:\n- \u201cWe show that, under assumptions A\u2013C, one derives a contradiction with condition D. We compare these assumptions to those typically used in standard quantum field theory.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 8. A concrete checklist\n\nBefore you try arXiv, check:\n\n- [ ] Written in LaTeX with standard packages.\n- [ ] Has: title, author, abstract, introduction, main sections, references.\n- [ ] At least one clearly stated theorem (or proposition/lemma) with a complete proof.\n- [ ] All claims about physics are either:\n  - Direct mathematical consequences of stated assumptions, or\n  - Clearly labeled as speculation.\n- [ ] References include:\n  - At least a few standard textbooks.\n  - Several recent arXiv or journal papers in the same area.\n- [ ] Tone is modest, technical, and free of emotional or political language.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste your abstract and section headings (or a sanitized version), and I can help you rephrase them into something that will look more professional and less likely to trigger immediate dismissal.",

These structures\ntypically involve infinite-dimensional spaces and unbounded operators,\nand thus rely on idealizations that invoke actual infinities. While\nsuch idealizations are mathematically convenient and have been\nextremely successful in describing experimental data, it is not\nobvious to what extent they are compatible with the requirement that\nphysically realizable systems are finite in extent and resources.\n\nIn this paper we investigate the consequences of imposing a\n``finiteness'' principle on the mathematical representation of\nphysical systems. Concretely, we assume that\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item[(i)] all physically realizable state spaces are\n  finite\\footnote{Here ``finite'' may refer to finite dimension,\n  finite cardinality, or bounded spectra; the precise notion will be\n  specified below.}, and\n  \\item[(ii)] all physically measurable quantities are represented by\n  operators with spectra satisfying [brief condition, e.g. boundedness\n  or discreteness].\n\\end{itemize}\nUnder these assumptions, we analyze the extent to which the usual\nHilbert-space framework of quantum mechanics can be maintained.\n\nOur main result is the following. We show that, under assumptions\n(i)\u2013(ii) and additional technical conditions A\u2013C, no theory can\nsimultaneously satisfy properties P, Q, and R, where:\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item P = [e.g. linearity of state evolution],\n  \\item Q = [e.g. exact reproduction of all predictions of standard\n  quantum mechanics for a given class of experiments],\n  \\item R = [e.g. representation of all observables as operators on a\n  single fixed state space].\n\\end{itemize}\nThis result may be viewed as a no-go theorem constraining finite or\ndiscrete reformulations of quantum theory.\n\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In\nSection~\\ref{sec:preliminaries} we review the standard Hilbert-space\nformalism and introduce the finiteness assumptions used in our\nanalysis. In Section~\\ref{sec:main-results} we state and prove our\nmain theorems concerning the incompatibility of these assumptions with\nproperties P\u2013R. In Section~\\ref{sec:examples} we illustrate the\nresults on simple model systems and compare them with standard quantum\nmechanical predictions.

Conceptual structure of a main theorem\n\nA good theorem statement has:\n\n1. **Clear assumptions** (\u201cLet \u2026 such that \u2026\u201d).\n2. **A precise conclusion** (what must hold / cannot hold).\n3. **Standard notation** (defined earlier or immediately before).\n\nAvoid words like \u201cshows physics is wrong\u201d in the theorem itself. The theorem should be purely mathematical; interpretation comes later.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Minimal LaTeX setup for theorems\n\nIn your preamble:\n\n```tex\n\\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,amsthm}\n\n\\theoremstyle{plain}\n\\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]\n\\newtheorem{lemma}[theorem]{Lemma}\n\\newtheorem{proposition}[theorem]{Proposition}\n\\newtheorem{corollary}[theorem]{Corollary}\n\n\\theoremstyle{definition}\n\\newtheorem{definition}[theorem]{Definition}\n\\newtheorem{remark}[theorem]{Remark}\n```\n\nThis gives you environments like `theorem`, `lemma`, etc., numbered by section.\n\n---\n\n## 3. A generic main theorem template (math-only)\n\nSuppose your result is a no-go type statement under a \u201cno infinity\u201d assumption. Here\u2019s a fully formed template:\n\n```tex\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:main}\nLet $\\mathcal{H}$ be a complex Hilbert space of finite dimension $d < \\infty$,\nand let $\\mathcal{A}$ be a set of self-adjoint operators on $\\mathcal{H}$\nrepresenting physically measurable observables. Suppose that the following\nconditions hold:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item[(A1)] (Linearity) The time evolution of states is given by a\n  one-parameter group of unitary operators $\\{U(t)\\}_{t \\in \\mathbb{R}}$\n  on $\\mathcal{H}$.\n  \\item[(A2)] (Nontriviality) The theory reproduces the standard quantum\n  mechanical predictions for the set of experiments $\\mathcal{E}$ described\n  in Definition~\\ref{def:experiments}.\n  \\item[(A3)] (Finiteness) All observables in $\\mathcal{A}$ have purely\n  discrete, finite spectra.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThen the theory cannot satisfy property (P):\n\\begin{quote}\n  (P) There exists a single representation of all observables in\n  $\\mathcal{A}$ on $\\mathcal{H}$ that is compatible with the predictions\n  of standard quantum mechanics for all experiments in $\\mathcal{E}$.\n\\end{quote}\nIn particular, under assumptions \\textnormal{(A1)\u2013(A3)} there is no\nfinite-dimensional model that reproduces all predictions of standard quantum\nmechanics for the class $\\mathcal{E}$.\n\\end{theorem}\n```\n\nNotes:\n\n- Replace `\\mathcal{H}`, `\\mathcal{A}`, `\\mathcal{E}`, (A1\u2013A3), and (P) with your actual objects and properties.\n- The theorem is purely about what can or cannot exist, given assumptions.

A more \u201cexistence/constructive\u201d style template\n\nIf your main result is constructive (e.g., \u201cI build a finite model that does X and fails Y\u201d):\n\n```tex\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:main-constructive}\nLet $\\mathcal{H}_N$ be the $N$-dimensional Hilbert space defined in\nDefinition~\\ref{def:finite-space}, and let $\\mathcal{A}_N$ be the\nalgebra of observables introduced in Section~\\ref{sec:model}. Then:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item[(i)] For every experiment $E \\in \\mathcal{E}_N$, the model\n  $(\\mathcal{H}_N, \\mathcal{A}_N)$ reproduces the standard quantum\n  mechanical probabilities up to error $\\varepsilon_N$, where\n  $\\varepsilon_N \\to 0$ as $N \\to \\infty$.\n  \\item[(ii)] The spectra of all observables in $\\mathcal{A}_N$ are\n  finite and uniformly bounded in $N$.\n  \\item[(iii)] Property (Q) from Definition~\\ref{def:property-Q}\n  fails for all $N$, i.e., the model does not admit [state what fails].\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{theorem}\n```\n\nThis kind of theorem says: \u201cHere is a finite model; here is what it does and does not do.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 5. How to connect this to \u201cno infinity in reality\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t put \u201cin reality\u201d inside the theorem. Instead:\n\n- In the **introduction** or a **definition**, you formalize your \u201cno infinity\u201d principle, e.g.:\n\n```tex\n\\begin{definition}[Finiteness principle]\\label{def:finiteness}\nA physical theory is said to satisfy the finiteness principle if all\nstate spaces are finite-dimensional and all observables have finite,\ndiscrete spectra.\n\\end{definition}\n```\n\nThen your theorem can say:\n\n```tex\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:no-go-finite}\nAny theory satisfying the finiteness principle (Definition~\\ref{def:finiteness})\nand assumptions \\textnormal{(A1)\u2013(A2)} cannot reproduce the full set of\npredictions of standard quantum mechanics for the class $\\mathcal{E}$.\n\\end{theorem}\n```\n\nInterpretation (e.g., \u201cthis suggests current formalism must be revised if one insists on strict finiteness\u201d) goes in the **Discussion** section, not in the theorem.\n\n---\n\n## 6. If you tell me your result, I can tailor it\n\nIf you describe, informally, what you actually proved (for example:  \n\u201cI assume all spectra are finite and show you can\u2019t have continuous translation symmetry,\u201d or  \n\u201cI show any finite-dimensional model that reproduces these experiments must violate linearity\u201d),  \nI can write a version of the main theorem statement that\u2019s much closer to your real content, in clean LaTeX and professional style.",

I\u2019ll give you a concrete template, then show where you need to plug in your specific definitions/assumptions.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Define the setting first\n\nSomewhere before the theorem (in \u201cPreliminaries\u201d or earlier in the \u201cMain results\u201d section), you should have precise definitions, e.g.:\n\n```tex\n\\begin{definition}[Finite-spectrum model]\\label{def:finite-spectrum-model}\nA finite-spectrum model for a quantum system with configuration space\n$X$ consists of:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item A complex Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$ of finite dimension\n        $d < \\infty$;\n  \\item A set of self-adjoint operators\n        $\\mathcal{A} = \\{A_1,\\dots,A_m\\}$ on $\\mathcal{H}$ representing\n        measurable observables;\n  \\item For each $A_j \\in \\mathcal{A}$, a finite set of eigenvalues\n        $\\sigma(A_j) = \\{\\lambda_{j,1},\\dots,\\lambda_{j,k_j}\\}$ with\n        $\\#\\sigma(A_j) < \\infty$;\n  \\item A unitary time-evolution operator $U(t)$ on $\\mathcal{H}$,\n        $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, satisfying $U(t+s) = U(t)U(s)$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nWe say that the model has finite spectra if every observable in\n$\\mathcal{A}$ has a finite spectrum.\n\\end{definition}\n```\n\nAnd you need a definition of \u201creproducing interference patterns\u201d, e.g.:\n\n```tex\n\\begin{definition}[Interference pattern for a two-slit experiment]\\label{def:interference}\nConsider a two-slit experiment with detection screen parametrized by\npositions $x \\in X$ and standard quantum mechanical intensity\ndistribution $I_{\\mathrm{QM}}(x)$ for a given initial state\n$\\psi \\in L^2(X)$. A model is said to reproduce the interference\npattern of this experiment if there exists a measurement scheme\nyielding detection probabilities $p(x)$ such that\n\\[\n  |p(x) - I_{\\mathrm{QM}}(x)| \\le \\varepsilon\n\\]\nfor all $x \\in X$ and some fixed $\\varepsilon \\ge 0$.\nWe say that the pattern is reproduced \\emph{exactly} if $\\varepsilon = 0$.\n\\end{definition}\n```\n\nAdjust this to match what you actually proved (exact vs approximate reproduction, discrete vs continuous screen, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 2. A clean main theorem statement\n\nHere is a professional-style theorem based on what you said. You will need to tweak the assumptions (A1\u2013A3) so they exactly match your proof.\n\n```tex\n\\begin{theorem}[No exact interference with finite spectra]\\label{thm:no-interference-finite}\nLet $\\mathcal{M}$ be a finite-spectrum model in the sense of\nDefinition~\\ref{def:finite-spectrum-model} for a two-slit experiment\nas described in Definition~\\ref{def:interference}. Suppose that:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item[(A1)] The model assigns to each slit configuration\n        (both slits open, only slit~1 open, only slit~2 open)\n        a state in $\\mathcal{H}$ and measurement operators in\n        $\\mathcal{A}$ such that the corresponding detection\n        probabilities are given by the Born rule.\n  \\item[(A2)] When only slit~1 or only slit~2 is open, the model\n        reproduces the standard quantum mechanical intensity\n        distributions $I_1(x)$ and $I_2(x)$ on the detection screen.\n  \\item[(A3)] All observables corresponding to detection on the screen\n        have finite spectra; in particular, the set of distinct\n        detection outcomes is finite.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThen $\\mathcal{M}$ cannot reproduce the interference pattern\n$I_{\\mathrm{QM}}(x)$ for the case where both slits are open in the\nsense of Definition~\\ref{def:interference} with $\\varepsilon = 0$.\nIn other words, under assumptions \\textnormal{(A1)\u2013(A3)}, no\nfinite-spectrum model yields exactly the same interference pattern as\nstandard quantum mechanics for this experiment.\n\\end{theorem}\n```\n\nThis says, in math language: with finite spectra and your assumptions, you cannot get *exact* quantum interference.\n\nIf your result is stronger or different (e.g., \u201ceven approximate reproduction up to some error is impossible,\u201d or \u201cfor arbitrarily fine screens\u201d), we can tune the conclusion accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## 3. If your result is approximate/impossibility in the limit\n\nIf your proof shows something like \u201cfor any finite-spectrum model, there is a lower bound on the error in the interference pattern,\u201d you can write:\n\n```tex\n\\begin{theorem}[Quantitative limitation for finite spectra]\\label{thm:quantitative-no-interference}\nLet $\\mathcal{M}$ be a finite-spectrum model as in\nDefinition~\\ref{def:finite-spectrum-model} satisfying\nassumptions \\textnormal{(A1)} and \\textnormal{(A2)} above.\nThen there exists a constant $\\delta > 0$, depending only on\nthe model $\\mathcal{M}$ and the experimental configuration, such that\nfor any measurement scheme in $\\mathcal{M}$ we have\n\\[\n  \\sup_{x \\in X} \\bigl| p_{\\mathcal{M}}(x) - I_{\\mathrm{QM}}(x) \\bigr|\n  \\ge \\delta,\n\\]\nwhere $p_{\\mathcal{M}}(x)$ denotes the detection probabilities\npredicted by $\\mathcal{M}$ and $I_{\\mathrm{QM}}(x)$ is the standard\nquantum mechanical intensity distribution for the two-slit experiment.\nIn particular, the interference pattern cannot be reproduced arbitrarily\nwell by any finite-spectrum model satisfying \\textnormal{(A1)}\u2013\\textnormal{(A2)}.\n\\end{theorem}\n```\n\nThis is even stronger: it says there\u2019s a nonzero minimum error.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Where to put the \u201cphysics is wrong\u201d part\n\nKeep the theorem itself purely mathematical. The interpretation goes later, e.g., in a Discussion/Conclusion section:\n\n```tex\n\\section{Discussion}\\label{sec:discussion}\n\nTheorem~\\ref{thm:no-interference-finite} shows that, under the\nfiniteness assumptions (A1)\u2013(A3), no model with finite spectra can\nexactly reproduce the interference pattern of the standard two-slit\nexperiment. If one insists that all physically realizable observables\nhave finite spectra, this result suggests that the usual Hilbert-space\nformulation of quantum mechanics, which employs infinite-dimensional\nspaces and continuous spectra, cannot be taken as a literally exact\ndescription of such experiments. Instead, it should be viewed as an\nidealization or limiting case of a more fundamental finite theory.\n```\n\nThis is the professional way to say \u201ccurrent physics needs revision if you reject actual infinities,\u201d without claiming \u201cphysics is wrong\u201d directly in the math statement.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me more detail about what your proof actually assumes (e.g., discrete screen points? specific form of the wavefunction? any symmetry assumptions?), I can refine the theorem statement to match your argument more closely.",

Make sure your idea is actually \u201cpublishable\u201d\n\nBefore worrying about arXiv mechanics, check you have the basics:\n\n- A clear *novel* architecture idea (what is new vs. existing models?)\n- A precise technical description (diagrams, equations, pseudocode)\n- Some empirical evidence it works (even if small\u2011scale):\n  - What datasets?\n  - What baselines?\n  - What metrics?\n  - How repeatable are your results?\n\nYou don\u2019t need a cluster, but you *do* need:\n- At least a few standard datasets or tasks (e.g., MNIST/CIFAR/IMDB/etc. depending on domain).\n- Comparisons to standard baselines (e.g., ResNet, Transformer, LSTM, MLP, etc. as appropriate).\n- Ablations or sanity checks if possible (what happens if you remove key components?).\n\nIf you only have \u201cit works great on my own custom dataset,\u201d reviewers and readers will not take it seriously.

Structure your paper\n\nEven for arXiv, you should aim for a real paper, not a note. Typical ML structure:\n\n1. **Title**  \n   Clear and descriptive. Example:  \n   \u201cXNet: A [Short Description] Neural Architecture for [Task/Domain]\u201d\n\n2. **Abstract**  \n   1 paragraph: problem, key idea, main results (with numbers), and significance.\n\n3. **Introduction**\n   - What problem are you addressing?\n   - Why current architectures are insufficient (with citations).\n   - Your proposed architecture in one or two sentences.\n   - Your contributions, clearly listed (e.g., bullet points).\n\n4. **Related Work**\n   - Architectures similar to yours (Transformers, ConvNets, MLP\u2011Mixer, etc.).\n   - How yours differs *specifically*.\n   - Place your work in the existing landscape.\n\n5. **Method / Architecture**\n   - Formal, precise description:\n     - Overall structure (diagram helps a lot).\n     - Layer types, connections, parameterization.\n     - Any new modules or operations (with math or pseudocode).\n   - Computational complexity if relevant (time, memory).\n\n6. **Experiments**\n   Be honest and explicit about constraints:\n   - Hardware: \u201cAll experiments were run on a single RTX 3080 with 10GB VRAM\u201d etc.\n   - Datasets: list them clearly and why you chose them.\n   - Baselines: at least a few standard ones.\n   - Metrics and training setup: optimizer, learning rate, epochs, batch size.\n   - Results tables and plots.\n   - Limitations: note that you haven\u2019t tested on large\u2011scale setups yet.\n\n7. **Ablation / Analysis** (if you can)\n   - Show that the new part of your architecture actually matters.\n   - E.g., remove the novel component and show performance drop.\n\n8. **Discussion & Limitations**\n   - Be explicit: \u201cWe have not yet evaluated on large\u2011scale benchmarks due to limited compute.\u201d\n   - Potential failure modes or open questions.\n   - Ideas for future large\u2011scale evaluation.\n\n9. **Conclusion**\n   - Summarize contributions and potential impact.\n\n10. **References**\n    - Use BibTeX and standard ML citations.\n\nUse the NeurIPS/ICLR/ICML style as a template; it makes your paper look familiar and serious.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Prepare the LaTeX and PDF\n\n1. Install LaTeX (or use Overleaf).\n2. Use a standard template (e.g., NeurIPS or ICLR).  \n   On Overleaf: \u201cNeurIPS 2024\u201d or similar.\n3. Add:\n   - Figures of your architecture (draw with PowerPoint, draw.io, Figma, TikZ, etc.).\n   - Tables for results.\n\nExport a clean PDF with:\n- No compilation errors.\n- All figures visible and legible.\n- References compiled correctly.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Create an arXiv account and get endorsement\n\n1. Go to: https://arxiv.org\n2. Create an account (with email verification).\n3. Fill in your profile (name, affiliation; you can use \u201cIndependent Researcher\u201d).\n4.

Submit the paper\n\n1. Go to \u201cSubmit\u201d on arXiv.\n2. Choose the category (cs.LG, stat.ML, etc.).\n3. Upload:\n   - Source files (LaTeX and figures) OR just the PDF (source recommended).\n4. Fill in:\n   - Title\n   - Authors\n   - Abstract\n   - Comments (e.g., \u201cX pages, Y figures\u201d)\n   - Journal reference (can leave blank if none)\n   - MSC/ACM classification (optional)\n5. Confirm and finalize submission.\n\nModeration:\n- arXiv moderators check for relevance and minimal quality.\n- As long as it looks like a real technical paper and not spam, you\u2019re usually fine.\n\nAfter acceptance:\n- It gets a permanent arXiv ID (e.g., 2401.01234).\n- That timestamp is your public claim.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Make your idea more \u201cdefensible\u201d and useful\n\nTo strengthen your claim and credibility:\n\n1. **Release code** (GitHub):\n   - Even if messy, a working implementation is powerful.\n   - Add a README with:\n     - Environment\n     - How to run experiments\n     - Example configs\n\n2. **Reproducibility**:\n   - Fix random seeds.\n   - Log hyperparameters.\n   - Include training scripts or configs.\n\n3. **Clear novelty statement**:\n   - In the paper and README, clearly summarize:\n     - What is *actually* new.\n     - How it differs from the closest known architecture.\n\n4. **Benchmark choice**:\n   - Use at least some standard benchmarks in your domain.\n   - Even small ones are better than none.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Be realistic about impact and reception\n\n- People in ML are skeptical of \u201crevolutionary\u201d claims without strong evidence.\n- That\u2019s fine: your goal right now is:\n  - Establish priority.\n  - Provide enough detail for others to try it.\n- If your idea is truly strong, others *will* attempt to scale and test it.\n\n---\n\n## 9. If you want, I can help refine it\n\nIf you\u2019d like concrete help:\n- Paste a rough outline of your architecture and experiments.\n- I can:\n  - Suggest a good title and abstract.\n  - Help structure the contributions section.\n  - Point out missing baselines or obvious criticisms you should pre\u2011empt.\n  - Draft a short \u201climitations\u201d paragraph that sounds professional, not apologetic.\n\nThis will make your arXiv submission much more credible, even without big\u2011cluster experiments.",

In our experiments on **[briefly mention domains/datasets, e.g., image and sequence classification benchmarks]**, NameNet consistently outperforms strong convolutional and Transformer-style baselines under matched training budgets.

RouteNet is built around a lightweight routing mechanism that connects non-adjacent layers and selectively mixes features across spatial locations. Rather than relying solely on fixed local convolutions or fully dense self-attention, RouteNet introduces a set of parameter-efficient gating blocks that dynamically choose which intermediate representations to propagate forward. This design yields a richer effective receptive field and more expressive representations, while keeping the per-layer computational cost close to that of standard residual convolutional layers.\n\nWe provide a formal description of the RouteNet architecture and analyze its computational complexity. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and a synthetic long-range dependency benchmark, and compare against strong baselines including ResNet-18, ResNet-34, and a small Vision Transformer (ViT-Ti) under matched training budgets. Across these tasks, RouteNet consistently achieves higher accuracy than comparable convolutional and Transformer-style architectures. For example, on CIFAR-10, RouteNet attains 96.3% test accuracy, compared to 94.8% for ResNet-18 and 95.1% for ViT-Ti, while using approximately 65% of the parameters and 70% of the floating-point operations of ResNet-18. On CIFAR-100, RouteNet improves top-1 accuracy from 75.2% (ResNet-18) to 77.9% under the same training schedule.\n\nWe further perform ablation studies that isolate the contribution of the cross-layer routing module. Removing this component and reverting to a purely residual convolutional stack leads to a 1.5\u20132.0 percentage point drop in accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, suggesting that the proposed connectivity mechanism is primarily responsible for the observed gains rather than incidental hyperparameter choices.\n\nAll experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 with 8 GB of VRAM, reflecting a realistic resource setting for many independent researchers and smaller organizations. As a consequence, we do not evaluate RouteNet on very large-scale benchmarks such as ImageNet-22K, LAION-scale vision-language data, or billion-parameter language modeling corpora, and we view large-scale evaluation and broader task diversity as important directions for future work.

Community / Practitioner channels\n\nGood for initial exposure and feedback.\n\n- **GitHub + Project Page**\n  - Make a nice README with images, results, usage examples.\n  - Pin the repo, add GitHub topics (e.g., `deep-learning`, `nlp`, etc.)\n\n- **Blog post / Medium / personal site**\n  - Tell the story: problem \u2192 approach \u2192 key insight \u2192 examples.\n  - Link the repo and any demo.\n  - Include code snippets and plots.\n\n- **Dev/ML platforms**\n  - Kaggle (if it fits a competition/Notebook format)\n  - Hugging Face Spaces (for a small demo with Gradio/Streamlit)\n  - Papers with Code: if you have results on a known benchmark later.\n\n- **Discussion forums**\n  - r/MachineLearning, r/datascience, Hacker News, relevant Discord/Slack groups.\n  - Post when you have: clear README, results, and preferably a blog-style explanation.\n\nThis alone often gets your work in front of professionals.\n\n---\n\n### B. More \u201cscientific\u201d dissemination\n\nIf you want academic-style credit/visibility:\n\n#### 1. arXiv\n\n- You don\u2019t need to be affiliated with a university.\n- Steps:\n  - Turn your write-up into a LaTeX paper (using an existing template like NeurIPS/ICLR/ICML).\n  - Create an arXiv account (may need endorsement in some categories; sometimes a co-author or a colleague can help, or you pick a category with lighter endorsement requirements).\n  - Upload PDF, source, and choose categories (e.g., cs.LG, stat.ML).\n\nPros:\n- Citable.\n- Many researchers browse arXiv daily.\n- Low barrier compared to peer-reviewed conferences.\n\nCons:\n- Not peer-reviewed (but that\u2019s increasingly normal in ML).\n\n#### 2. Workshops and smaller conferences\n\nWorkshops are often more welcoming to non-traditional authors:\n\n- Look at major conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, CVPR, etc.) and their workshops.\n- Workshops often accept:\n  - Short papers (4\u20136 pages)\n  - Non-archival submissions\n  - Less \u201cstate-of-the-art or bust\u201d than main tracks.\n- There are also regional or applied ML conferences that are less competitive.\n\nStrategy:\n- Start with a workshop submission:\n  - Adapt your write-up to their template.\n  - Think carefully about experiments and baselines; reviewers care about these.\n- Even if rejected, you\u2019ll get feedback you can use to improve the work.\n\n#### 3. Journals\n\nMore formal and slower; might be overkill at first. But for some applied domains (medicine, engineering, finance), a smaller domain journal might be a good match.\n\n---\n\n## 4. What reviewers/scientists care about\n\nTo make your work \u201cscientific\u201d rather than just \u201ccool code,\u201d focus on:\n\n- **Clarity of the problem**: Is it clearly defined and motivated?\n- **Comparison to baselines**:\n  - Simple baselines (e.g., linear models, standard architectures).\n  - Existing published methods if possible.\n- **Sound evaluation**:\n  - Proper train/validation/test splits.\n  - No data leakage.\n  - Reporting mean \u00b1 std over multiple runs if randomness matters.\n- **Ablations / analysis**:\n  - Try removing your \u201cspecial trick\u201d and show performance changes.\n  - Investigate which part of the model actually helps.\n\nEven modest but carefully evaluated improvements are taken more seriously than big claims with sloppy evaluation.\n\n---\n\n## 5. If you want a concrete action plan\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step you could follow over the next weeks:\n\n1. **This week**\n   - Clean repo, add README, environment, license.\n   - Make it easy to run main experiment.\n\n2. **Next 1\u20132 weeks**\n   - Write a paper-style document in Markdown/LaTeX.\n   - Add at least 1\u20132 strong baselines and clean experimental results.\n\n3. **Weeks 3\u20134**\n   - Publish a blog post describing the work for a general tech audience.\n   - Share on Reddit (r/MachineLearning), maybe Hacker News, and relevant communities.\n\n4. **After feedback**\n   - Refine experiments and writing based on comments.\n   - Decide whether to:\n     - Upload to arXiv, and/or\n     - Target a specific workshop or small conference.\n\n---\n\nIf you describe your project (task, type of model, how you evaluated it), I can help you:  \n- outline a paper tailored to it,  \n- suggest specific venues/workshops that fit, and  \n- draft the abstract/introduction.",

Draft introduction\n\n### 1. Introduction\n\n> Many real-world applications in [DOMAIN, e.g., finance, healthcare, natural language processing, sensor data analysis] rely on accurate and robust [TASK, e.g., classification, regression, anomaly detection]. In recent years, advances in machine learning, particularly in [TYPE OF MODELS: deep neural networks, gradient boosting machines, transformers], have significantly improved performance on standard benchmarks for [TASK]. However, these methods often assume access to [CONDITIONS: large labeled datasets, substantial compute, specialized expertise], which can be unrealistic in [YOUR CONTEXT: small-scale projects, resource-constrained environments, niche domains where labels are scarce].  \n>  \n> In exploring [TASK] as a personal project, we observed that commonly used baselines such as [BASELINE 1, e.g., logistic regression], [BASELINE 2, e.g., XGBoost], and [BASELINE 3, e.g., a standard deep model like a CNN or transformer] either [LIMITATIONS YOU SAW: underfit the data, require careful feature engineering, or are too expensive to train and deploy] in our setting. At the same time, more sophisticated architectures from the literature can be [DRAWBACKS: complex to implement, sensitive to hyperparameters, or overkill for medium-sized, noisy, or heterogeneous data]. This motivated us to search for a middle ground: a model that is simple enough to be implemented and tuned by a non-expert, yet strong enough to compete with established baselines.  \n>  \n> In this work, we introduce **[YOUR METHOD NAME]**, a [METHOD TYPE: e.g., compact neural architecture / training framework / hybrid model] for [TASK] that emphasizes [DESIGN GOAL: simplicity, efficiency, robustness]. The core idea is to [KEY INTUITION IN 1\u20132 SENTENCES: e.g., combine a lightweight backbone with a task-specific attention or pooling mechanism, augment the training data using a simple generative strategy, or incorporate domain priors via a custom loss or architecture constraint]. Despite its simplicity, [YOUR METHOD NAME] consistently outperforms standard baselines on [NUMBER] public datasets covering [BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DATA VARIETY, e.g., different domains, sizes, or noise levels].  \n>  \n> We evaluate [YOUR METHOD NAME] on [LIST MAIN DATASETS], comparing against [LIST BASELINE FAMILIES, e.g., linear models, tree-based methods, and deep neural networks]. Across these experiments, [YOUR METHOD NAME] achieves [SUMMARY OF GAINS: e.g., higher accuracy/F1, lower error, or more stable training] while using [COMPUTE/MODEL ADVANTAGE: fewer parameters, less training time, smaller memory footprint]. To better understand why the method works, we perform a series of ablation studies and analyses examining [COMPONENTS: the impact of each architectural component, the role of regularization, sensitivity to dataset size].  \n>  \n> Our contributions are as follows:\n> - **A simple and practical method for [TASK]**, [SHORT DESCRIPTION OF WHAT\u2019S NEW: e.g., combining a compact backbone with a task-specific mechanism or loss], designed to be accessible to non-expert practitioners while remaining competitive with strong baselines.\n> - **A thorough empirical evaluation** on [NUMBER] publicly available datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements over [BASELINE TYPES, e.g., linear models, gradient boosting, and standard deep architectures] in terms of [PRIMARY METRICS].\n> - **An ablation and analysis of design choices**, showing that [KEY FINDING, e.g., a particular architectural choice or training trick] is crucial for the observed performance gains and that the method is robust to [ASPECT: hyperparameters, dataset size, noise].\n> - **An open-source implementation**, including code, configuration files, and pretrained models at [GITHUB URL], to facilitate easy reproduction, comparison, and extension by the community.\n>  \n> Taken together, these results suggest that relatively modest architectural and training adjustments, when carefully evaluated, can yield substantial practical benefits for [TASK] without requiring complex or resource-intensive machinery.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Experiments\n\n#### 4.1 Datasets\n\n> We evaluate **[YOUR METHOD NAME]** on [NUMBER] publicly available datasets spanning [DOMAIN(S), e.g., text, tabular, time series]. This selection is intended to test the method under varying conditions of dataset size, feature dimensionality, and noise.\n> \n> - **[DATASET 1]**: [1\u20132 sentences: what it is, size]. For example: \u201c[DATASET 1] is a [TYPE, e.g., text classification / tabular benchmark] dataset containing [N] samples and [D] features / [NUMBER] classes. We follow the standard [TRAIN/VAL/TEST SPLIT OR K-FOLD PROTOCOL] used in [CITATION OR COMMON PRACTICE].\u201d\n> - **[DATASET 2]**: \u201c[DESCRIPTION: domain, size, any special characteristics, e.g., class imbalance or time dependencies].\u201d\n> - **[DATASET 3]**: \u201c[DESCRIPTION].\u201d\n> \n> For all datasets, we apply minimal preprocessing to reflect realistic usage. [DESCRIBE PREPROCESSING: e.g., for text we lowercase and tokenize using [TOKENIZER]; for tabular data we standardize continuous features and one-hot encode categorical features; for time series we resample to a fixed frequency and normalize each series]. No task-specific feature engineering is performed beyond these generic steps.\n\n#### 4.2 Baselines\n\n> We compare **[YOUR METHOD NAME]** against a set of strong and widely used baselines:\n> \n> - **[BASELINE 1: e.g., Logistic Regression]**: A linear model trained on the same features used by our method. We include L2 regularization and tune the regularization strength on the validation set.\n> - **[BASELINE 2: e.g., XGBoost / Random Forest]**: A tree-based ensemble method that often performs strongly on [TABULAR / MIXED] data. We use the implementation from [LIBRARY, e.g., XGBoost/LightGBM/scikit-learn] and tune key hyperparameters such as [NUMBER OF TREES, MAX DEPTH, LEARNING RATE] on the validation set.\n> - **[BASELINE 3: e.g., MLP / CNN / Transformer]**: A standard deep learning baseline commonly used for [TASK]. For example, an [N]-layer [MLP/CNN/Transformer] with [HIDDEN SIZE, ACTIVATION] trained with [OPTIMIZER]. Architecture and hyperparameters are chosen to be representative of typical practice and are tuned on the validation set.\n> - **[OPTIONAL BASELINE 4: e.g., published method if applicable]**: If relevant, we also compare to [NAME OF PUBLISHED METHOD] using [OFFICIAL / OPEN-SOURCE IMPLEMENTATION] where available.\n> \n> We focus on baselines that are reasonably well-known and accessible to practitioners, to provide a meaningful comparison for real-world usage.\n\n#### 4.3 Experimental Setup\n\n> For all methods, we use [FRAMEWORK, e.g., PyTorch/TensorFlow/scikit-learn] and run experiments on [HARDWARE, e.g., a single NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU and an 8-core CPU]. We report results in terms of [PRIMARY METRIC, e.g., accuracy, macro-F1, RMSE] on the test set; for datasets with class imbalance, we additionally report [SECONDARY METRIC, e.g., ROC-AUC, PR-AUC].  \n>  \n> We allocate [PERCENTAGE, e.g., 10\u201320%] of the training data as a validation set (or use the standard validation split, if defined) for hyperparameter tuning and early stopping. To account for variability due to random initialization and data shuffling, we run each experiment [NUMBER, e.g., 3 or 5] times with different random seeds and report the mean and standard deviation.  \n>  \n> [YOUR METHOD NAME] is trained using [OPTIMIZER, e.g., AdamW] with an initial learning rate of [VALUE], batch size [VALUE], and for up to [EPOCHS] epochs with early stopping based on validation [METRIC]. We apply [REGULARIZATION, e.g., dropout with rate p, weight decay \u03bb] as described in Section [METHOD SECTION]. All hyperparameters for both our method and the baselines are selected via grid search or reasonable ranges informed by prior work, and the search space is documented in Appendix [LETTER].\n\n#### 4.4 Main Results\n\n> Table 1 summarizes the performance of **[YOUR METHOD NAME]** and all baselines on the [NUMBER] datasets. On [NUMBER] out of [TOTAL] datasets, [YOUR METHOD NAME] achieves the best performance in terms of [PRIMARY METRIC]. In particular, on [DATASET X], it reaches [SCORE] compared to [BEST BASELINE SCORE] for the strongest baseline ([RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT, e.g., a relative improvement of 6.2%]). On [DATASET Y], the gains are more modest but still positive, with [YOUR METHOD NAME] achieving [SCORE] versus [SCORE] for [BASELINE].  \n>  \n> Overall, [YOUR METHOD NAME] yields an average improvement of [\u0394 VALUE] in [PRIMARY METRIC] across all datasets compared to the best-performing baseline, while using [COMPUTE/MODEL ADVANTAGE, e.g., 30\u201350% fewer parameters, lower memory consumption, or shorter training time]. These results suggest that the combination of [KEY DESIGN ASPECTS, e.g., the compact architecture and task-specific mechanism] is effective across varied data regimes, particularly in [SPECIFIC CONDITIONS WHERE YOU SEE BIGGEST GAINS, e.g., smaller datasets, noisy labels, high-dimensional but sparse features].  \n>  \n> Beyond aggregate metrics, we also examined qualitative behavior where applicable. For example, on [TEXT OR SEQUENCE DATASET], [YOUR METHOD NAME] tends to [OBSERVABLE PATTERN, e.g., better capture long-range dependencies or correctly handle rare but important patterns], which may explain the observed performance differences.\n\n*(Here you would actually include:)*\n\n- *Table 1: Performance (mean \u00b1 std) of all methods on each dataset.*\n- *Optionally some plots: accuracy vs. training epochs, or error vs. model size.*\n\n#### 4.5 Ablation Studies and Analysis\n\n> To understand which components of **[YOUR METHOD NAME]** are responsible for its performance, we conduct ablation experiments on [ONE OR TWO REPRESENTATIVE DATASETS]. We systematically remove or modify individual components and report the effect on [PRIMARY METRIC].  \n>  \n> - **Without [COMPONENT A]** (e.g., remove a special layer, attention mechanism, or regularization term): Performance drops from [FULL MODEL SCORE] to [ABLATION SCORE], indicating that [COMPONENT A] is critical for [OBSERVED BEHAVIOR, e.g., handling class imbalance, improving generalization].\n> - **Without [COMPONENT B]**: The change in performance is [SMALLER/LARGER], suggesting that [COMPONENT B] provides [ROLE, e.g., a modest but consistent regularization effect].\n> - **Varying [HYPERPARAMETER OR MODEL SIZE]**: We vary [PARAMETER, e.g., hidden dimension, number of layers, strength of regularization] and observe that performance is relatively stable in the range [RANGE], but degrades when [EXTREME VALUES], as shown in Figure [NUMBER]. This indicates that the method does not require extremely precise tuning to work well.\n>  \n> We also analyze [OPTIONAL EXTRA ANALYSIS, e.g., training curves, calibration, or resource usage]. For instance, Figure [NUMBER] compares training and validation curves for [YOUR METHOD NAME] and [BASELINE], showing that our method [TRAIT, e.g., converges faster, is less prone to overfitting]. Measured in terms of wall-clock time, [YOUR METHOD NAME] trains in [TIME] on [HARDWARE], compared to [TIME] for [COMPARABLE BASELINE], highlighting its practicality for [YOUR CONTEXT].  \n>  \n> These ablations and analyses support our claim that relatively simple modifications\u2014specifically, [NAME KEY COMPONENTS]\u2014are sufficient to obtain robust improvements over standard baselines without introducing significant complexity.\n\n---\n\n## 4.
