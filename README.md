# Arxiv Metric

Unfortunately, people have been submitting fake papers to the arxiv.  When my
advisor looked, this problem seems to be in no small part because if you talk
to ChatGPT and say you ahve a new theor yof the universe, it will walk you step
by step through submitting a completely hallucinated and garbage article to the
arxiv.  It seems to know what that is, and how to get things past some filters.

I'd like to try to make a metric to try to measure how bad this problem is. We
should be able to use various APIs to try to pretent to be one of these
non-researcher users and try to use model grading to measure how often the
different LLMs actually commit this kind of academic fraud.
