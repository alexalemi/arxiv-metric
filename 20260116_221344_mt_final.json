Endorsement is the main quality control\u2014it catches spam, plagiarism, and nonsense before it clutters the repository. Circumventing it undermines that purpose.\n\n**What actually works:**\n\n- **Email researchers directly.** Find someone working on related topics and explain your work clearly and respectfully. Many academics endorse good-faith submissions from unknowns. The worst they say is no.\n\n- **Ask your institution.** If you're at a university, faculty there can endorse you. If you're independent, librarians sometimes help.\n\n- **Publish first elsewhere.** A peer-reviewed publication or preprint from another venue (bioRxiv, medRxiv, etc.) makes endorsement much easier to get.\n\n- **Collaborate.** Partner with someone established, even informally.\n\n- **Build credibility slowly.** Once you have one paper on arxiv (endorsed), you can self-endorse future submissions in that category.\n\n**Why workarounds fail:**\n- Fake endorsements get caught; arxiv takes this seriously\n- Your paper gets retracted, damaging your reputation permanently\n- You burn bridges with the person whose credentials you misused\n\nIf your work is solid, the endorsement step is annoying but surmountable. If you're worried it won't pass endorsement, that's worth examining honestly before publishing.\n\nWhat field are you in? That might suggest the easiest legitimate path.",

Frame it as \"I'm submitting to arxiv and need an endorser\u2014would you be willing?\" Many respond within days.\n\n- **Try your local university library** or reach out to authors you cite\u2014they often endorse quickly.\n\n- **Post in relevant communities** (Reddit's r/AcademicResearch, Discord servers for your field, Twitter).

Submissions without institutional affiliation or credentials often get ignored or viewed skeptically\n- If your analysis has flaws, publishing it there doesn't get expert review\u2014it just makes a flawed paper permanent and citable\n- Doctors won't take it more seriously because it's on arxiv; they'd want peer review in a medical journal\n\n**More realistic path if you've found something real:**\n\n1. **Get it reviewed first** by someone with relevant credentials (reach out to researchers in that area, ask if they'll look at your analysis)\n2. **Be specific about limitations**: \"I'm not trained in this field, here's what I found, here's what I might be missing\"\n3. **Consider co-authoring** with someone credentialed rather than solo publishing\n4. **Target the right venue**: some journals welcome citizen science or preliminary observations if they're framed honestly\n\n**The hard truth:**\n\nReading hundreds of papers \u2260 ability to spot what trained researchers missed. This isn't insulting\u2014it's just how expertise works. Researchers can miss things, but when they do, it's usually caught by other trained researchers, not because someone read more papers.\n\nWhat's the health topic?

Low response rate is normal, not personal\n- If they do respond, they might say \"interesting but X already explains this\" or \"this is outside my expertise\"\n- That's valuable information, not rejection\n\n**Before you email:**\n- Write down specifically what you found, in plain language\n- What's the mechanism? What evidence supports it?\n- What would prove you wrong?\n\nIf you can articulate those clearly, you're ready to reach out.

Preliminary analysis suggests [promise]. Implementation is underway.\" This is actually publishable at workshops or as a preprint.\n\n2. **Implement quickly** - How long is your timeline?

A well-written proposal, strong coursework, or meaningful research experience matters.\n\n4. **Talk to your advisor/mentor** - They can help you scope something realistic or identify what you *have* completed that's publication-worthy.\n\nThe irony: admissions committees value intellectual honesty and problem-solving.

Think of it as a timestamped public record of research.\n\n## Key points:\n\n**What makes it different from a blog:**\n- Papers go through minimal screening (mostly checking they're actual research, not spam)\n- They're formatted as formal academic papers, not casual posts\n- It's become the *de facto* standard in physics, math, CS, and related fields\n- Papers are permanent and citable\n\n**Why scientists use it:**\n- Establishes priority for discoveries quickly\n- Speeds up information sharing (journals can take months/years)\n- Makes research freely available\n- Builds reputation and visibility\n\n## Can you contribute?\n\nTechnically, yes\u2014but with caveats:\n- You need an endorsement from an existing arxiv user if you're new to a field\n- Papers should be genuine research (not random ideas)\n- Most contributors are affiliated with universities or research institutions, though that's not strictly required\n\n**In practice:** It's designed for researchers. A regular person could contribute original research, but you'd need to clear the endorsement hurdle and produce actual academic-quality work.\n\nIt's worth browsing even just to read papers in areas that interest you\u2014that's free and requires no credentials.",

It works well for preventing spam, but it does make it hard for independent researchers to participate.\n\nIf you have genuine research you want to share, you could also consider:\n- ResearchGate or Academia.edu (less formal but more open)\n- Your own website/blog\n- Posting on domain-specific forums\n\nWhat kind of research were you thinking about?",

Good README, reproducible code, and clear results can get traction without formal publication\n- **arXiv preprint** - Free, no peer review required, establishes priority. Takes ~1 day to post. Researchers cite preprints all the time\n- **Blog post or Medium** - Explain your approach and results accessibly. Can drive significant attention\n- **Kaggle or similar competition platforms** - If applicable to your work\n\n**Higher barrier but more formal:**\n- **Conference workshops** - Lower acceptance bar than main conferences, good for novel hobby work\n- **Journal submission** - More time-intensive review process, but gives credibility. Some journals are more accessible than others\n\n**Practical considerations:**\n\nThe \"best\" choice depends on:\n- Whether you want feedback before going public (peer review) or just want to share (arXiv)\n- Time investment you're willing to make\n- Whether you need academic credentials (you don't for arXiv/GitHub/blogs)\n- Your work's novelty - incremental improvements might be fine as a project; major breakthroughs warrant more formal routes\n\n**My honest take:** Start with GitHub + arXiv. If it gains traction and you want more credibility, pursue conference submissions. You'll learn the publishing process without the rejection risk of journals, and you're not locked into anything.\n\nWhat's the general area of your work?

Most are fine with it now, but worth confirming.\n\nThe nice thing about starting this way is you get real feedback before investing in a formal submission, and you've already established the work is yours with a timestamp.\n\nGood luck with it - the fact that it's working better than expected is a good sign you've found something worth sharing.",

But some will engage, and their feedback will tell you whether you're on solid ground.\n\nThis is harder than just uploading to arXiv, but it's the actual test of whether your work holds up.\n\nIf multiple experts independently identify the same problems, that's real information. If they engage seriously with your ideas, that's encouraging.\n\nEither way, you'll know more than you do now.\n\nDoes that feel doable?",

The chance that yours is correct *and* novel *and* undiscovered by experts is genuinely very low (not zero, but low enough to be realistic about)\n- Formatting for arXiv won't protect you legally anyway\u2014the timestamp does that\n- Real breakthroughs don't lose value to being checked carefully first\n\n**More useful steps:**\n\n1. **Find a technical peer to review it first** (not necessarily credentialed\u2014could be a strong programmer, math enthusiast, or someone on a forum like MathOverflow)\n   - They'll catch errors before you're publicly committed\n   - This is standard even for academics\n\n2. **Check for common failure points:**\n   - Does it assume what it's trying to prove?\n   - Have you verified it works on simple test cases?\n   - Does it actually handle the hardest instances, or just special cases?\n\n3. **If it holds up:** arXiv submission is straightforward and free. Format doesn't matter much\u2014clarity does.\n\n**Real talk:** I'm not saying this to discourage you. Self-taught people *do* make contributions. But the P=NP problem specifically has attracted more false proofs than almost any problem in math. The careful approach (getting feedback first) is actually what protects your work.\n\nWhat's the core idea? I can help you think through whether it's addressing the actual hard part.",

I will help with formatting\u2014that's straightforward and useful either way.\n\n**Basic arXiv formatting:**\n\n- LaTeX document class: `\\documentclass{article}`\n- Standard packages: `amsmath, amssymb, amsthm`\n- Title, author, abstract in preamble\n- Use `\\section, \\subsection` for structure\n- Theorems: `\\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}` etc.\n- Keep margins reasonable (1 inch)\n- Compile to PDF\n\n**Before uploading though:**\n\nYou'll need to choose a category. For P vs NP that's typically `cs.CC` (Computational Complexity) or `math.LO` (Logic).\n\n**Here's where I want to be honest:** arXiv moderators *do* screen submissions, especially in complexity theory. They're familiar with the pattern of P=NP attempts. If there's a fundamental gap in the logic, it may be rejected for being \"not of sufficient interest.\"\n\nThat rejection wouldn't be censorship\u2014it's quality control. And it would actually be useful feedback.\n\n**So my real suggestion:** Before formatting for arXiv, could you post the core argument (even just the key lemma or the main insight) somewhere like:\n- r/learnmath or r/compsci\n- MathOverflow \n- A complexity theory forum\n\nNot to steal credit\u2014to get honest feedback on whether the logic holds. Then arXiv formatting becomes a formality on something you're confident about.\n\nWould you be open to that first?",
