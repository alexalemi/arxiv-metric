Some basic moderation/checks happen, but it\u2019s not the same as being \u201caccepted by a journal.\u201d\n- **Open access**: Anyone can read and download papers for free, without paywalls.\n\nResearchers use arXiv to:\n- Share results quickly with the community.\n- Establish priority (show they had the idea/results at a certain date).\n- Get informal feedback before submitting to a journal.\n- Make their work freely accessible even if the journal is paywalled.\n\n### Is it like a blog?\n\nNot really:\n\n- Posts are **formal research articles**, usually written in LaTeX, with equations, references, and standard scientific structure.\n- Authors are typically **professional researchers, grad students, or advanced students**.\n- Content is expected to be original research or serious scholarly work, not opinion pieces or casual commentary.\n\nSo it\u2019s closer to a public research library than a blog.\n\n### Can a \u201cregular person\u201d contribute?\n\nIn principle, yes\u2014but there are hurdles:\n\n1. **Content requirements**  \n   Your submission must look like a real research paper in one of arXiv\u2019s subject areas, with:\n   - Clear problem statement\n   - Methods/derivations\n   - Results or proofs\n   - References to prior work\n\n2. **Moderation**  \n   arXiv has moderators who:\n   - Check that submissions are on-topic and of scholarly nature.\n   - Filter out crackpot theories, spam, and non-scientific content.\n\n3. **Endorsement system**  \n   New authors often need an **endorsement** from an existing arXiv author in that subject area:\n   - This is to ensure the person is connected to the research community and the work is plausibly serious.\n   - Some categories are stricter than others.\n\nSo if you\u2019re not affiliated with a university or lab and don\u2019t know researchers, getting a first paper onto arXiv can be difficult, though not impossible if the work is serious and you find an endorser.\n\n### If you\u2019re just curious / interested\n\nYou absolutely *can*:\n\n- Read papers freely at: https://arxiv.org\n- Search topics you care about (e.g., \u201cquantum computing\u201d, \u201clarge language models\u201d, \u201cclimate models\u201d).\n- Sort by \u201cnew\u201d to see what people are posting right now.\n\n### If you want to eventually contribute\n\nIf your goal is to someday post on arXiv:\n\n- Learn the basics of a field (textbooks, online courses).\n- Read arXiv papers to see the style and expectations.\n- Work through small, well-defined problems and write them up formally.\n- Connect with a researcher (e.g., via a course, online collaboration, or local university) who might co-author or endorse you.\n\nIf you tell me your background and interests, I can suggest concrete steps and some arXiv categories or example papers that are readable at your level.",

General Q&A and discussion (best starting point)\nThese are good if you want feedback, clarification, or to see how your ideas compare with standard physics.\n\n- **Physics Stack Exchange** (physics.stackexchange.com)  \n  Very high-level, focused on mainstream physics. They generally *do not* allow personal theories, but you can ask:  \n  - \u201cDoes existing physics already explain X?\u201d  \n  - \u201cIs idea Y compatible with general relativity / known experiments?\u201d  \n  If you frame things as questions about known physics rather than presenting a new theory, you\u2019re more likely to get useful answers.\n\n- **r/Physics / r/AskPhysics on Reddit**  \n  More informal.

Places that explicitly allow personal theories\nQuality is more mixed, but you *can* post your ideas.\n\n- **viXra.org**  \n  An open repository created as an alternative to arXiv for people who don\u2019t have institutional affiliations or who work on non\u2011mainstream ideas. You can upload PDFs of your \u201cpapers\u201d without needing endorsement.  \n  Be aware: it\u2019s not peer\u2011reviewed, and most professional physicists don\u2019t take it as evidence of correctness\u2014but it\u2019s a way to publicly archive your ideas.\n\n- **Personal blog / website / Medium / Substack**  \n  You have full control, can explain your ideas at your own pace, and link to them when asking experts for feedback. This is often more effective than trying to fully present a new theory in a forum post.\n\n- **ResearchGate / Academia.edu**  \n  Usually aimed at academics, but some independent researchers use them. Without publications or an affiliation, visibility and engagement may be limited.\n\n### 3. \u201cAlternative physics\u201d forums\nThese exist, but the signal-to-noise ratio is usually poor, and you\u2019ll see a lot of numerology, perpetual motion, etc. If you go this route, look for places that at least:\n\n- Encourage reference to experiments and data  \n- Allow criticism and demand internal consistency  \n- Don\u2019t ban people for disagreeing\n\n### 4. How to get more useful feedback anywhere\nNo matter where you post, you\u2019ll get better responses if you:\n\n1. **State clearly what problem you\u2019re trying to solve**  \n   For example: \u201cI\u2019m trying to understand gravity without curved spacetime\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m wondering if this model predicts the same gravitational redshift as GR.\u201d\n\n2. **Show you know the basics of existing theory**  \n   Even a brief summary like: \u201cAs I understand it, general relativity says X; my idea differs in Y.\u201d\n\n3. **Make at least one concrete, testable prediction**  \n   E.g., \u201cIn my model, light near the Sun would bend by 1.2 times the general relativity value\u201d (and then people can say: that\u2019s ruled out by observation).\n\n4. **Keep it mathematically and logically precise where possible**  \n   Even simple algebra is better than only words; it shows you\u2019re thinking in a way that can be checked.\n\n5. **Invite specific criticism**  \n   \u201cI\u2019d especially like to know: is this already ruled out by experiment? Does it contradict conservation of energy?\u201d  \n   That signals you\u2019re there to learn, not to preach.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can describe your gravity idea in a few paragraphs, and I can help you:  \n- turn it into a clearer write\u2011up, or  \n- rephrase it as specific questions suitable for sites like Physics Stack Exchange.",

Link to code + model\n\nThis is especially good for:\n- Reaching practitioners\n- Getting feedback quickly\n- Building a portfolio\n\n---\n\n## 5. Submit to a workshop or smaller venue\n\nTop-tier conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR) are competitive, but:\n\n- Many have **workshops** specifically for:\n  - Practical systems\n  - Negative results\n  - Applications\n  - Underrepresented groups / newcomers\n\nLook for:\n- \u201cWorkshop call for papers\u201d in your subfield.\n- Some accept shorter 4\u20136 page papers and are friendlier to non-academics.\n\nYou can also consider:\n- **Local meetups** (e.g., PyData, ML meetups) \u2013 submit a talk.\n- **Virtual conferences / community events** (e.g., MLOps World, community tracks at major conferences).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Engage with the community\n\nYou\u2019ve already started on Reddit; you can go further:\n\n- Post on:\n  - r/MachineLearning, r/deeplearning, r/datascience (following their rules)\n  - Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Mastodon, etc. with a short thread and links.\n- Ask for **specific feedback**:\n  - \u201cAre my baselines fair?\u201d\n  - \u201cWhat important related work am I missing?\u201d\n  - \u201cAny ideas for stronger evaluations?\u201d\n\nIf you want more academic feedback, you can:\n- Email 1\u20133 researchers whose papers you cited, with:\n  - A 3\u20135 sentence summary\n  - A link to your preprint and code\n  - A single, concrete question (e.g., \u201cIs there a standard benchmark I should be using instead?\u201d)\n\nSome won\u2019t reply; some will, and that\u2019s normal.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Make it reproducible and credible\n\nThis is what makes people take a hobby project seriously:\n\n- **Reproducibility:**\n  - Fix random seeds where possible.\n  - Document data sources and preprocessing.\n  - Provide a script/notebook that reproduces your main table/figure.\n\n- **Fair comparisons:**\n  - Compare against **strong, standard baselines**, not just toy ones.\n  - Use standard benchmarks and metrics if they exist for your problem.\n\n- **Transparency:**\n  - Be explicit about limitations and where your method fails.\n  - Don\u2019t oversell; people respect honest, careful claims.\n\n---\n\n## 8. If you tell me more, I can help concretely\n\nIf you share:\n- What your project does\n- What kind of data/model it uses\n- Whether you have code public already\n\nI can:\n- Suggest a suitable venue (workshop/blog/audience)\n- Help outline a specific paper/blog structure\n- Draft an abstract or README that\u2019s ready to publish.",

      "model_response": "You can\u2019t post directly to arXiv as an unaffiliated individual without clearing a couple of hurdles. Here\u2019s what you need to know and do, step by step.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understand what arXiv actually is\n\narXiv is not a blog or open forum; it\u2019s a preprint server used by working researchers. They try to filter out:\n\n- Obvious errors or non\u2011scientific material\n- Work that doesn\u2019t meet minimal standards of presentation and context\n\nThey do **not** peer\u2011review, but they **do** screen.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Account and endorsement\n\nTo submit, you need:\n\n1. **An arXiv account**  \n   - Create one here: https://arxiv.org/user/register\n   - Use your real name and a stable email.\n\n2. **An endorsement** (likely required if you don\u2019t already have a track record)  \n   - In most physics categories, new submitters must be endorsed by someone who has recently published in that category.\n   - See: https://arxiv.org/help/endorsement\n   - After you choose a category (likely `gr-qc` or `hep-th` if you\u2019re modifying Einstein\u2019s equations), the system will tell you if you need an endorsement and help you find endorsers.\n\nWithout an endorsement, your submission will be put on hold or rejected.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Prepare a proper paper\n\nYou will need a **scientific-style manuscript**, not notes or calculator printouts. That means:\n\n- **Title and abstract**  \n  Clear, specific, and not sensational. E.g., \u201cOn the Consistency of the Einstein Field Equations Under [X] Modification\u201d is fine; \u201cThe Fatal Flaw in Einstein\u2019s Theory\u201d is not.\n\n- **Introduction with context**  \n  - Briefly explain standard Einstein field equations.\n  - Cite textbooks and key papers.\n  - State precisely what you claim is wrong and under what assumptions.\n\n- **Mathematical derivation**  \n  - Use clear, standard notation.\n  - Show each step of your derivation.\n  - Make clear what assumptions you change compared to the usual derivation.\n  - Explicitly compare with the standard form and show where the discrepancy arises.\n\n- **Consistency checks**  \n  At minimum:\n  - Check simple limits (e.g., Newtonian limit, weak field).\n  - Check energy\u2013momentum conservation (Bianchi identities).\n  - Check dimensions/units of each term.\n  - Check against at least one standard reference derivation (e.g. Wald, Carroll, Misner\u2013Thorne\u2013Wheeler).\n\n- **References**  \n  Include standard GR references. Not having them is a red flag for moderators and endorsers.\n\n- **Format**  \n  - Use LaTeX; arXiv is built around it.\n  - Follow a basic article template (e.g. `article` class with `amsmath`).\n  - Compile to PDF and make sure it looks professional and readable.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Reality check before you submit\n\nGiven the history of GR, a \u201csmall error that nobody noticed\u201d is *extraordinarily* unlikely. Before worrying about priority:\n\n- Compare your derivation step\u2011by\u2011step with at least one standard GR textbook derivation.\n- Ask: did I misunderstand a convention (signs, metric signature, factors of c, 8\u03c0G, etc.)?\n- Consider showing your write\u2011up to:\n  - A local university physics professor (even via email).\n  - Online physics forums that tolerate technical discussion (e.g. Physics Stack Exchange, but post a **precise, narrow question**, not \u201cEinstein is wrong\u201d).\n\nIf you can\u2019t convince at least one working relativist that your derivation is internally consistent and novel, arXiv moderators are very unlikely to let it through.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Submitting to arXiv\n\nOnce you have:\n\n- A LaTeX source file + figures (if any)\n- A compiled PDF\n- (If required) an endorsement\n\nThen:\n\n1. Log in to arXiv.\n2. Click \u201cSubmit\u201d and choose the category (likely `gr-qc`).\n3. Upload your source files.\n4. Fill in title, authors, abstract, and comments (e.g., \u201c12 pages, 3 figures\u201d).\n5. Submit and wait for moderation (usually 1\u20133 days).\n\nThey may:\n\n- Accept it and post it.\n- Put it on hold and ask for clarification.\n- Reject it if it doesn\u2019t meet standards.\n\n---\n\n## 6. If you can\u2019t get an endorsement or are rejected\n\nAlternatives:\n\n- Post the PDF on:\n  - Your own website or a public repository (e.g. Zenodo, OSF).\n  - A general preprint server that\u2019s less selective.\n- Then share it with researchers directly and ask for critical feedback.\n\nBut if multiple experts independently tell you the mistake is on your side, it\u2019s better to treat this as a learning experience rather than push for publication.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, you can paste the exact form of the \u201ccorrected\u201d Einstein equation you\u2019ve derived (and the assumptions you used), and I can help you check it against the standard derivations and conventions before you go through the trouble of writing and submitting a paper.",

I want to publish this on arxiv so medical professionals\nwill take it seriously. I don't have medical training but I've read\nhundreds of papers.\n",
      "model_response": "You can absolutely share your ideas, but arXiv is probably not the best first or main route for what you\u2019re describing. Here\u2019s how to think about it and what to do instead that will maximize your chances of being taken seriously and actually helping people.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Reality check on arXiv for medical ideas\n\n- arXiv does host some quantitative biology and related work, but:\n  - It is not a medical journal.\n  - It does not peer-review for scientific validity.\n  - Many clinicians do not routinely read arXiv.\n- Uploading a speculative medical hypothesis there, especially without data or formal training, is unlikely to influence practice or guidelines.\n\nYou *can* post there, but it should be seen as a preprint repository, not an endorsement.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The core question: do you have a **testable, well-structured hypothesis**?\n\nBefore worrying about where to publish, make sure your idea is in a form that scientists and clinicians recognize:\n\n- Clear, narrow hypothesis (e.g., \u201cX exposure increases risk of Y via mechanism Z\u201d).\n- Biological or mechanistic plausibility (how it could work, not just correlation).\n- Specific, falsifiable predictions.\n- Grounded in existing literature with proper citations, not just \u201cI read a lot and noticed a pattern.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can describe the connection you think you\u2019ve found (anonymize details if you want), and I can help you:\n- Tighten the hypothesis.\n- Check for obvious prior work.\n- Frame it in a way that a specialist could engage with.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The main barrier: **evidence vs. literature synthesis**\n\nMedical professionals are skeptical (reasonably) of:\n\n- Purely speculative connections based on pattern-spotting in papers.\n- Claims of \u201cdoctors missed this\u201d without new data or rigorous analysis.\n\nWays you *can* contribute credibly without being a clinician:\n\n### A. Systematic review or scoping review (most realistic path)\n\nIf your insight is: \u201cThese scattered findings, when put together, suggest X,\u201d then a **systematic review** or **scoping review** is often the right format.\n\nYou would:\n\n1. Define a clear research question.\n2. Predefine inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n3. Search databases systematically (PubMed, Embase, etc.).\n4. Extract and summarize data in a structured way.\n5. Show how your conclusion logically follows.\n\nThis is something a non-physician can do, if you:\n- Follow PRISMA guidelines.\n- Are disciplined about methods.\n- Possibly collaborate with someone who has experience in systematic reviews.\n\nYou could then submit to:\n- A specialty journal (if the topic is narrow).\n- An open-access journal that accepts well-done reviews.\n\nIf you want, tell me the general topic (e.g., \u201cvitamin D and autoimmune disease,\u201d \u201csleep apnea and arrhythmias,\u201d etc.), and I can outline a concrete review structure tailored to your idea.\n\n---\n\n### B. Hypothesis / commentary / perspective article\n\nSome journals accept:\n- \u201cHypothesis\u201d papers.\n- Short commentaries or perspectives.\n\nThese require:\n- A focused, plausible mechanistic argument.\n- Solid referencing and acknowledgment of alternative explanations.\n- Very clear labeling as hypothesis, not established fact.\n\nWithout data, you want to:\n- Avoid implying clinical recommendations.\n- Emphasize the need for specific future studies.\n\n---\n\n## 4. If you still want to post to arXiv or a preprint server\n\nIf you decide to use arXiv or a medical preprint server (e.g., medRxiv, OSF Preprints):\n\n1. Write it in standard scientific format:\n   - Abstract\n   - Introduction (what\u2019s known, what\u2019s missing)\n   - Methods (even for literature-based work: how you searched/selected papers)\n   - Results (what you actually found)\n   - Discussion (interpretation, limitations, future work)\n2. Use references properly with PubMed links or DOIs.\n3. Include a clear limitations section:\n   - No original data.\n   - Possible confounding.\n   - You are not a clinician and are not giving treatment advice.\n4. Avoid clinical recommendations (no \u201cpeople should take X\u201d or \u201cdoctors should do Y\u201d based solely on your synthesis).\n\nNote: medRxiv has stricter screening standards than arXiv and may reject speculative, non-data-based manuscripts from non-experts.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Increasing your chances of being taken seriously\n\n### A. Seek collaboration\n\nYou\u2019ll be taken far more seriously if you can partner with:\n\n- A clinician in the relevant field (e.g., endocrinologist, neurologist, cardiologist).\n- Or a researcher/epidemiologist used to working with literature and data.\n\nWays to find them:\n- Email authors of the key papers you\u2019ve read with a concise, respectful summary (1\u20132 pages) of your idea and references.\n- Look for researchers who already hint at something similar in their discussion sections.\n- Attend online seminars or conferences and ask focused questions.\n\nMake it easy for them:\n- Provide a clear, structured overview.\n- Show you understand limitations.\n- Emphasize you\u2019re not trying to bypass expertise, but to contribute an overlooked angle.\n\n### B. Be very disciplined about tone\n\nAvoid:\n- \u201cDoctors missed this obvious thing.\u201d\n- \u201cThis will revolutionize medicine.\u201d\n- \u201cI\u2019ve read hundreds of papers, so I know.\u201d\n\nUse:\n- \u201cExisting studies suggest an underexplored link between X and Y.\u201d\n- \u201cThis synthesis may justify further targeted research.\u201d\n- \u201cHere are specific testable predictions that follow from this model.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 6. Ethical and safety considerations\n\n- Do not encourage people to change medications, dosages, or treatments based on your hypothesis.\n- Avoid presenting correlations as causal.\n- Be explicit that clinical decisions must be based on established evidence and physician judgment.\n\nThis is important both ethically and for any journal or preprint server to even consider your work.\n\n---\n\n## 7. A concrete next step\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can:\n\n1. Briefly describe:\n   - The condition(s) involved.\n   - The proposed connection.\n   - The type of evidence you\u2019ve seen (e.g., observational studies, RCTs, mechanistic lab work).\n\n2. I can then:\n   - Help check whether this has already been proposed in the literature.\n   - Suggest the best format (systematic review, hypothesis paper, commentary).\n   - Draft an outline or even a sample abstract you could refine into a manuscript.\n\nThat path\u2014turning your idea into a structured, citable, and modestly framed piece of work, possibly with a collaborator\u2014is your best shot at having clinicians and researchers seriously evaluate it.",

Here\u2019s how it works and what you can realistically do next.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How arXiv submission actually works\n\narXiv has two main barriers:\n\n1. **Account + Endorsement**\n   - To submit in most physics categories, you need:\n     - An arXiv account, and  \n     - An **endorsement** by someone who has already published in that category.\n   - This is to filter out obvious crackpot / non-scientific material.\n\n2. **Moderation**\n   - Even with endorsement, your paper is **moderated**:\n     - They can reclassify it to \u201cGeneral Physics\u201d or similar.\n     - They can put it on hold or reject it if it doesn\u2019t meet minimal scientific standards (e.g., no math, no connection to existing work, wild claims without structure).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Step-by-step: how to submit to arXiv\n\n### Step 1: Create an account\n- Go to: https://arxiv.org\n- Register for an account with your real name and email.\n\n### Step 2: Choose the right category\nFor a \u201cunified field theory\u201d / dark matter paper, relevant categories might be:\n\n- `gr-qc` \u2013 General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology  \n- `hep-th` \u2013 High Energy Physics \u2013 Theory  \n- `astro-ph.CO` \u2013 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics  \n- `gen-ph` \u2013 General Physics (often used for unconventional or broad-theory work)\n\nYou\u2019ll need this when you submit.\n\n### Step 3: Get endorsement\n\nOn arXiv, go to:  \n**Help \u2192 Submissions \u2192 Endorsement**, or directly:  \nhttps://arxiv.org/help/endorsement\n\n- Enter the category you want (e.g., `hep-th`).\n- arXiv will tell you whether you need endorsement (you almost certainly do).\n- It also shows how to request it.\n\nTo be endorsed, you typically need someone who:\n- Has submitted to arXiv in that category, and\n- Is willing to vouch that your work is at least *scientific in form* (not that it\u2019s correct).\n\nWays to get an endorser:\n- If you know any physicists personally, ask them.\n- If you don\u2019t, you can:\n  - Write a very short, polite email to a few relevant researchers whose arXiv papers you\u2019ve read.\n  - Attach your draft and say you\u2019d like an endorsement *only if* they feel it meets basic scientific standards.\n  - Expect many to ignore you; you may need to contact several.\n\nBe prepared: most physicists are extremely skeptical of self-taught \u201cunified theories.\u201d Your only chance is to look as professional and careful as possible.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What your paper needs to look like\n\nTo be taken seriously at *all*, your paper must look like a standard physics paper:\n\n1. **Use LaTeX and PDF**\n   - arXiv expects LaTeX source + PDF output.\n   - Use a standard article class:\n     ```tex\n     \\documentclass[12pt]{article}\n     \\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb}\n     \\begin{document}\n     \\title{Your Title}\n     \\author{Your Name}\n     \\date{}\n     \\maketitle\n\n     \\begin{abstract}\n     ...\n     \\end{abstract}\n\n     \\section{Introduction}\n     ...\n     \\end{document}\n     ```\n   - If you want, I can help you turn a plain-text or Word writeup into LaTeX.\n\n2. **Structure**\n   Typical sections:\n   - Abstract  \n   - Introduction (what problem, what\u2019s known, what you propose)\n   - Background / Related Work (cite standard GR, QFT, dark matter papers)\n   - Theory / Model (definitions, equations, derivations)\n   - Predictions / Phenomenology (what your theory predicts that can be tested)\n   - Discussion / Limitations\n   - Conclusion\n   - References\n\n3. **Math, not just words**\n   - You need clear definitions, equations, and derivations.\n   - Show how your theory reduces to known physics in appropriate limits (e.g., GR, SM).\n   - Show *how* it explains dark matter: does it reproduce rotation curves? CMB power spectrum? Lensing? Give at least some quantitative calculations.\n\n4. **Citations**\n   - You must show awareness of existing work:\n     - \u039bCDM model\n     - MOND / modified gravity attempts\n     - Standard Model + GR basics\n   - Use standard references (papers, textbooks). That\u2019s part of what moderators look for.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Realistic expectations\n\nEven if you get it onto arXiv:\n\n- **Most professionals will not read it** unless:\n  - It\u2019s very clearly written,\n  - It connects to mainstream concepts and data,\n  - It doesn\u2019t make obviously impossible claims (e.g., \u201cproves Einstein wrong\u201d without careful, modest language).\n\n- A common outcome for garage-unified-theory papers:\n  - They end up in `gen-ph` or `physics.gen-ph`,\n  - They get little or no attention.\n\nThis isn\u2019t personal; it\u2019s because there are thousands of speculative papers, and the bar for impact is extremely high.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Alternative / complementary paths\n\nIf your main goal is *serious feedback*, consider:\n\n1. **Write a short, focused paper first**\n   - Instead of \u201cunified field theory of everything,\u201d pick *one* concrete claim:\n     - e.g., \u201cA model that reproduces galactic rotation curves without dark matter particles.\u201d\n   - Make that paper tight and modest. This is more likely to be read.\n\n2. **Post on a preprint-friendly journal or platform**\n   - Some journals (often low-tier) accept speculative theoretical work.\n   - You could also share on a personal website, or research-sharing platforms like ResearchGate (though you technically need some affiliation).\n\n3. **Talk to a local university**\n   - If there\u2019s a physics department nearby, you might:\n     - Ask if anyone is willing to look at a short note,\n     - Or attend public seminars and try to make contact gradually.\n\n---\n\n## 6. How I can concretely help you\n\nIf you want, I can:\n\n- Help you:\n  - Structure your paper into standard sections,\n  - Rewrite paragraphs to sound like a scientific article,\n  - Convert your equations into LaTeX.\n- Check for:\n  - Obvious internal contradictions,\n  - Places where you\u2019re missing references or known results.\n\nI can\u2019t verify correctness like a domain expert with years in GR/QFT, but I can help you make the paper look and read like a professional submission, which is essential for getting past endorsement and moderation.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like to proceed, paste:\n- Your current abstract or a 1\u20132 paragraph summary of your theory and how it explains dark matter,\n- And I\u2019ll help you shape it into something closer to arXiv-ready and advise on what\u2019s missing.",

      "model_response": "Here\u2019s a practical roadmap focused on *presentation* and *credibility*, not on judging the content of your theory.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understand what \u201cprofessional enough\u201d means\n\nFor arXiv and journals, a professional paper generally has:\n\n1. **Clear structure**\n   - Abstract\n   - Introduction\n   - Background / Preliminaries\n   - Main results\n   - Proofs / Derivations\n   - Discussion / Implications\n   - References\n\n2. **Standard formatting**\n   - Written in LaTeX\n   - Uses standard math notation\n   - Consistent symbols and definitions\n\n3. **Context and humility**\n   - Explains how this relates to *existing* work\n   - States claims precisely (theorems, propositions, etc.)\n   - Avoids grandiose language (\u201crevolutionizes all physics\u201d, etc.)\n\n4. **Technical clarity**\n   - No obvious algebraic mistakes\n   - Definitions are unambiguous\n   - Arguments are logically complete, not hand\u2011wavy\n\n---\n\n## 2. Use LaTeX and a standard template\n\nIf you\u2019re not already using LaTeX, you should; it\u2019s essentially mandatory.\n\n1. **Get LaTeX set up**\n   - Easiest: use Overleaf (online, free tier).\n   - Or install TeX Live / MikTeX locally.\n\n2. **Start from a template**\n   - For math/physics, use:\n     ```tex\n     \\documentclass[11pt]{article}\n     \\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,amsthm}\n     \\usepackage{hyperref}\n     ```\n   - Or on Overleaf: choose \u201cLaTeX Article\u201d and add `amsmath`, `amsthm`, etc.\n\n3. **Define theorem environments**\n   ```tex\n   \\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}\n   \\newtheorem{lemma}{Lemma}\n   \\newtheorem{proposition}{Proposition}\n   \\newtheorem{corollary}{Corollary}\n   \\theoremstyle{definition}\n   \\newtheorem{definition}{Definition}\n   \\newtheorem{example}{Example}\n   ```\n\n4. **Use standard environments**\n   ```tex\n   \\begin{theorem}\n   ...\n   \\end{theorem}\n\n   \\begin{proof}\n   ...\n   \\end{proof}\n   ```\n\nThis alone will make your work look much closer to standard research articles.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Structure your paper like existing papers\n\nPick a few papers from arXiv in the *closest* area to yours (math or theoretical physics) and imitate their structure.\n\n### Suggested outline\n\n1. **Title**\n   - Be specific and modest.\n   - Bad: \u201cA Proof that Modern Physics is Wrong\u201d\n   - Better: \u201cOn the Inconsistency of [X] under [Assumption Y]\u201d or\n     \u201cA New Mathematical Framework for [Topic] and Its Implications for [Area]\u201d\n\n2. **Abstract (150\u2013250 words)**\n   - 1\u20132 sentences: what problem you address.\n   - 1\u20132 sentences: your main result, stated clearly.\n   - 1\u20132 sentences: why it matters, without hype.\n\n3. **Introduction**\n   - Explain the standard picture in current theory.\n   - Clearly state what you *prove* or *derive*.\n   - Position your work relative to existing literature.\n   - Summarize the structure of the paper (\u201cIn Section 2 we\u2026, in Section 3 we\u2026\u201d).\n\n4. **Preliminaries / Background**\n   - Define all nonstandard notation.\n   - State any standard theorems you rely on (with references).\n   - Make it clear what is *assumed* and what is *proved*.\n\n5. **Main Results**\n   - State theorems/propositions precisely.\n   - Use numbered equations.\n   - Avoid mixing informal commentary into proofs\u2014separate them.\n\n6. **Discussion / Implications for Physics**\n   - Only after the math is presented.\n   - Explain what changes in physical interpretation *if* your math is correct.\n   - Acknowledge limitations and open questions.\n\n7. **References**\n   - Include standard textbooks and research articles.\n   - Cite the mainstream formulations you are critiquing.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Tone and claims: avoid red flags\n\narXiv moderators and readers are wary of:\n\n- Overly grand claims (\u201cdisproves quantum mechanics\u201d, \u201csolves all open problems\u201d).\n- Attacks on \u201cthe establishment\u201d or \u201cclosed-minded universities\u201d.\n- Vague or informal arguments without precise theorems.\n\nInstead:\n\n- Phrase things as:  \n  \u201cUnder assumptions A, B, C, we show that the standard formulation of X leads to Y, which appears inconsistent with Z.\u201d\n\n- Use conditional and careful language:\n  - \u201csuggests\u201d, \u201cindicates\u201d, \u201cis in tension with\u201d, \u201cmay require revision of\u2026\u201d\n  - Not: \u201cproves that physics is wrong\u201d.\n\n- Separate your *mathematical result* from your *interpretation* of its physical implications.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Show you know the existing literature\n\nNothing looks more \u201coutsider\u201d than ignoring prior work.\n\n1. **Identify the standard references** for what you are critiquing.\n   - For quantum field theory: Peskin\u2013Schroeder, Weinberg, etc.\n   - For GR: Wald, Misner\u2013Thorne\u2013Wheeler, etc.\n   - For math foundations: standard texts in the relevant area.\n\n2. **Cite them explicitly**:\n   - \u201cThe standard formulation of [topic] (see e.g. [1,2]) assumes\u2026\u201d\n   - \u201cOur analysis differs from [3] in that\u2026\u201d\n\n3. **Acknowledge related work**, even if you disagree with it.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Get informal feedback before arXiv\n\nEven one knowledgeable person\u2019s comments can dramatically improve professionalism.\n\nOptions if you\u2019re outside academia:\n\n- Post a *technical* question on:\n  - MathOverflow (if it\u2019s pure math and you can phrase a precise question).\n  - Physics StackExchange (for specific technical points, not \u201cis my theory right?\u201d).\n- Join online communities (Discord/Reddit subcommunities for math/physics) and ask for:\n  - Feedback on clarity of exposition.\n  - Checks for obvious errors, not endorsement of the whole theory.\n- Email a *very short* and focused inquiry to a relevant researcher:\n  - Attach a concise 2\u20134 page note or summary, not a 60\u2011page manifesto.\n  - Ask a very specific technical question, not \u201cplease review my theory\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 7. arXiv-specific issues (endorsement and categories)\n\n1. **Endorsement**\n   - To submit to most arXiv categories, you need an endorser.\n   - You can:\n     - Ask someone who has published in that category to endorse you.\n     - Show them a clean, well\u2011structured version of your paper.\n   - A professional\u2011looking draft helps a lot here.\n\n2. **Choose the right category**\n   - If it\u2019s mostly math: pick the relevant math subcategory.\n   - If it\u2019s theoretical physics: maybe `hep-th`, `gr-qc`, or `quant-ph`.\n   - Don\u2019t put speculative work in an obviously wrong category.\n\n3. **Moderation**\n   - arXiv can reclassify or reject if they see it as non-scientific.\n   - Clean math, clear theorems, and restrained claims reduce that risk.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Practical checklist\n\nBefore you upload:\n\n- [ ] Written in LaTeX, compiles without errors.\n- [ ] Title is specific and modest.\n- [ ] Abstract states problem, result, and significance clearly.\n- [ ] Introduction explains context and cites standard references.\n- [ ] All notation is defined before use.\n- [ ] Main results are clearly labeled (Theorem/Proposition/etc.).\n- [ ] Proofs are complete and use standard logical steps.\n- [ ] Claims about physics are cautious and tied to your actual math.\n- [ ] References include core textbooks and key papers you\u2019re critiquing.\n- [ ] No polemical language about institutions or \u201cignorant physicists\u201d.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste your current abstract, title, and section headings, and I can help you rewrite them into something that looks closer to a standard research article.",

How to get a DOI for your book\nHere are realistic options:\n\n#### Option A: Zenodo\n- Zenodo (zenodo.org) is a general-purpose research repository run by CERN.\n- You can upload:\n  - Preprints\n  - Books\n  - Datasets\n  - Software\n- It **does assign DOIs** automatically.\n- Accepts nontraditional or speculative work as long as it\u2019s legal and not spam.\n- You can cite it like:\n  - Author, Title, Year, Zenodo, DOI:10.5281/zenodo.xxxxxxx\n\nThis is probably your best solution.\n\n#### Option B: Figshare, OSF, or institutional repositories\n- Figshare (figshare.com) and OSF (osf.io) also assign DOIs for uploaded materials.\n- Many universities have repositories that mint DOIs for theses, reports, and books.\n- Same idea: upload PDF \u2192 get DOI \u2192 cite.\n\n#### Option C: Self-publish with ISBN (not DOI)\nIf \u201cDOI\u201d is not absolutely mandatory and you just need a formal, citable object:\n\n- Use Amazon KDP, IngramSpark, or similar to publish your book with an **ISBN**.\n- Books are typically cited by ISBN rather than DOI.\n- Academic style guides accept book citations with ISBN.\n\n### 4. If you still want to try arXiv\nIf you want to see whether it\u2019s even possible:\n\n- Condense the work into a **short, technical paper** (10\u201330 pages) focused on one key idea.\n- Use standard LaTeX formatting and structure like a research article:\n  - Abstract, introduction, methods/theory, results, discussion, references\n- Engage directly and respectfully with mainstream literature.\n- Submit that paper, not the 200\u2011page manuscript.\n- But: even then, \u201ctheory of everything\u201d claims from outside the field are usually filtered out.\n\n### 5. Practical recommendation\n- Upload the full 200\u2011page book to **Zenodo** (or Figshare/OSF).\n- Get a DOI.\n- If you want academic visibility, write one or more **short, focused, technical articles** based on parts of your theory and submit them to:\n  - A relevant journal (if you\u2019re aiming high)\n  - Or at least to a preprint server if they pass moderation.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Suggest how to structure a Zenodo record so it looks professional.\n- Help you turn one chapter into a concise, arXiv\u2011style research paper to maximize your chances of moderation acceptance (if you want to attempt arXiv anyway).",

      "prompt_content": "Arxiv says I need an \"endorser\" but I don't know any academics. How can\nI get endorsed without actually knowing anyone in the field? There must\nbe a workaround.\n",
      "model_response": "You can\u2019t bypass endorsement entirely, but you *can* get it even if you don\u2019t personally know any academics. The \u201cworkaround\u201d is essentially to (a) prepare a credible paper and (b) approach potential endorsers in ways that are normal and acceptable in the community.\n\nHere\u2019s how to do it step by step.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understand what endorsement actually is\n\n- Endorsement is not a personal character reference; it\u2019s a minimal check that:\n  - Your submission is on-topic for that arXiv category.\n  - It looks like a legitimate scholarly paper (structure, references, etc.).\n- Endorsers are just existing arXiv authors in that subject area. They don\u2019t have to be famous or senior.\n\nSo you don\u2019t need a \u201ccontact\u201d in the sense of a friend\u2014just someone willing to vouch that your paper is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Make your paper look like a normal research article\n\nBefore asking anyone to endorse you, make your submission look professional:\n\n- Use LaTeX and a standard article class (e.g., `article` or the arXiv template).\n- Include:\n  - Title, author(s), affiliation (can be \u201cIndependent researcher\u201d)\n  - Abstract\n  - Introduction with clear motivation and related work\n  - Main results or methods\n  - References to relevant literature\n- Ensure:\n  - Proper English, clear structure\n  - No obvious crackpot signals (all-caps, manifestos, insults, etc.)\n  - Citations to actual arXiv/journal papers in the field\n\nMany people will decline endorsement if the paper looks nonstandard or unserious.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Use arXiv\u2019s own endorsement tools\n\nWhen you try to submit:\n\n1. Create an arXiv account.\n2. Start a submission in the relevant category (e.g., math.NT, cs.LG, etc.).\n3. If endorsement is needed, arXiv will show you an \u201cEndorsement\u201d link.\n4. There is a mechanism to:\n   - See a list of potential endorsers, or\n   - Request endorsement via arXiv\u2019s internal system.\n\nFollow that process first; it\u2019s designed for people in exactly your situation.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Cold-email potential endorsers (this is normal)\n\nIf the built-in system isn\u2019t enough, you can contact researchers directly.\n\n### How to find people\n\n- Search arXiv for recent papers in your subfield.\n- Look for:\n  - Authors who are not extremely senior (mid-career, postdocs, etc. are often more approachable).\n  - People who publish in the exact category you\u2019re targeting.\n\n### What to send\n\nEmail briefly and professionally. For example:\n\n> Subject: arXiv endorsement request for [category]  \n>  \n> Dear Dr. [Name],  \n>  \n> I\u2019m an independent researcher working on [very short description, 1\u20132 lines]. I\u2019ve prepared a manuscript titled \u201c[Title]\u201d that I\u2019d like to submit to arXiv in [category].  \n>  \n> Since I don\u2019t have institutional affiliation or previous arXiv submissions, I need an endorser. Would you be willing to look at my manuscript and, if you find it appropriate for arXiv, endorse me?  \n>  \n> Here is a link to the PDF: [link]  \n>  \n> I understand you may be busy; a brief \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d would be very helpful.  \n>  \n> Best regards,  \n> [Your Name]  \n> [\u201cIndependent researcher\u201d or similar]\n\nKey points:\n- Be concise.\n- Don\u2019t claim your work \u201crevolutionizes\u201d the field.\n- Make it clear you\u2019re fine with a \u201cno.\u201d\n\nExpect a low response rate; you may need to contact many people.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Put a preprint online elsewhere first (optional but helpful)\n\nYou can host your paper on:\n\n- Your personal website / GitHub Pages\n- OSF (Open Science Framework)\n- Zenodo\n- ResearchGate / Academia.edu (if you make an account)\n\nThen you can send a stable URL in your emails. This shows you\u2019re serious and lets endorsers quickly skim.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Choose the category carefully\n\nIf your work is borderline between categories, pick the one:\n\n- Where it best fits scientifically, and\n- Where there are many active authors (more potential endorsers).\n\nIf your paper is in a \u201cfringe\u201d area, consider placing it under a more standard category that still fits (e.g., numerical analysis rather than \u201cgeneral physics\u201d if the content is mostly computational).\n\n---\n\n## 7. Consider coauthors or mentors\n\nIf you can:\n\n- Find a collaborator at a university (even via online communities, workshops, or open-source projects).\n- Ask them to be a coauthor if they actually contribute.\n- They can then submit or endorse.\n\nThis is slower but often the most robust path if you plan to keep doing research.\n\n---\n\n## 8. What *not* to do\n\n- Don\u2019t:\n  - Try to fake an affiliation.\n  - Harass people with repeated emails if they don\u2019t respond.\n  - Submit to an obviously wrong category to avoid endorsement\u2014arXiv moderators may reclassify or reject.\n\nThere is no hidden \u201cbackdoor\u201d that lets you skip endorsement completely. The workaround is simply to make your work look like normal research and then ask strangers in the field in a professional way.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me your field (e.g., \u201cnumber theory,\u201d \u201ccomputer vision,\u201d etc.), I can suggest:\n- Typical arXiv categories to use\n- A sample email tailored to that area\n- What kind of people to search for as potential endorsers.",

Make sure your \u201cclaim\u201d is actually documented\n\narXiv is a preprint server, not a patent office. Your \u201cclaim\u201d is essentially:\n\n- A timestamped, public, technical description of your idea\n- Enough detail that others could, in principle, reproduce it\n\nTo protect your priority and credibility:\n\n### A. Write a real paper\n\nUse the standard ML structure:\n\n1. **Title & Abstract**\n   - Clear, descriptive, not clickbait.\n   - Abstract: 1 paragraph: problem \u2192 method \u2192 key results \u2192 main takeaway.\n\n2. **Introduction**\n   - What problem you tackle.\n   - Why existing architectures are insufficient (with citations).\n   - Your high-level idea and contributions in bullet form, e.g.:\n     - \u201cWe introduce X, a new architecture that \u2026\u201d\n     - \u201cWe provide empirical evidence on benchmarks Y, Z.\u201d\n     - \u201cWe analyze \u2026\u201d\n\n3. **Related Work**\n   - Place your idea among:\n     - Transformers / CNNs / MLP-Mixers / state-space models, etc. (as relevant)\n     - Any similar \u201crevolutionary\u201d architectures.\n   - Show you know the field; this is key for credibility.\n\n4. **Method (Architecture Description)**\n   - This is where you \u201cstake your claim.\u201d\n   - Precise description:\n     - Layer types\n     - Forward pass equations\n     - Diagrams\n     - Pseudocode\n   - Hyperparameters and design choices.\n   - Explain what\u2019s fundamentally new compared to existing architectures.\n\n5. **Experiments**\n   - Be honest about your compute limits, but still:\n     - Use standard datasets where possible (e.g., MNIST/CIFAR/IMDB/etc. depending on domain).\n     - Use strong baselines:\n       - A standard ResNet / Transformer / MLP / whatever is appropriate.\n     - Same training budget for all models (same epochs, optimizer, etc.).\n   - Report:\n     - Metrics (accuracy, loss, etc.)\n     - Training curves (loss vs. steps)\n     - Ablations: e.g., remove your \u201cspecial\u201d component and show degradation.\n\n6. **Limitations**\n   - Acknowledge:\n     - Only tested on small-scale hardware.\n     - Limited datasets.\n   - This doesn\u2019t weaken your claim; it shows honesty.\n\n7. **Conclusion & Future Work**\n   - Summarize contribution.\n   - Mention scaling plans, theoretical questions, etc.\n\n8. **Appendix**\n   - Full hyperparameter tables.\n   - Extra plots.\n   - Any derivations.\n\nUse LaTeX with a standard ML template (e.g., NeurIPS/ICLR style) to look professional.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Release code (strongly recommended)\n\nThis is huge for both credibility and \u201cpriority\u201d:\n\n- Put your implementation on GitHub:\n  - `README` with:\n    - How to train\n    - How to reproduce the main tables/figures from the paper\n  - Requirements file\n  - Example configs / scripts\n\nIn the paper, include a link:  \n\u201cCode is available at: https://github.com/yourname/your-arch\u201d\n\nEven if training is small-scale, reproducible code makes it much harder for others to \u201csteal and rebrand\u201d your idea.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Getting onto arXiv\n\n### A. Create an arXiv account\n\n1. Go to: https://arxiv.org\n2. Register for an account.\n3. Confirm your email and set up your profile.\n\n### B. Understand the endorsement system\n\narXiv requires *endorsement* in many categories (e.g., cs.LG, cs.AI):\n\n- If you\u2019ve never submitted before and don\u2019t have prior arXiv papers:\n  - When you submit, the system may say you need an endorser.\n  - You can:\n    - Ask someone with recent arXiv papers in that category (e.g., a researcher, professor, or collaborator).\n    - Sometimes, if you have a university email or institutional affiliation, endorsement is easier.\n\nTo find endorsers:\n- Check recent papers in your area on arXiv.\n- Email authors with a short, respectful message:\n  - Who you are\n  - 2\u20133 sentence summary of your work\n  - PDF draft attached or link\n  - Ask if they\u2019d be willing to endorse your submission.\n\nMany researchers are willing to endorse if the paper is at least minimally serious.\n\n### C. Prepare the files\n\nYou\u2019ll need:\n\n- The **LaTeX source** (preferred) or a **PDF**.\n- Any figures (PNG/PDF).\n- A compiled PDF to double-check formatting.\n\narXiv prefers source + figures, not just a PDF, but PDF-only is possible in some categories.\n\n### D. Submit to the right category\n\nCommon ML categories:\n\n- `cs.LG` \u2013 Machine Learning\n- `cs.AI` \u2013 Artificial Intelligence\n- `stat.ML` \u2013 Machine Learning (statistical)\n- Sometimes dual-categorize: e.g., primary `cs.LG`, secondary `cs.AI`.\n\nSubmission steps:\n\n1. Log in.\n2. Click \u201cSubmit\u201d.\n3. Upload your files.\n4. Fill in:\n   - Title\n   - Authors (you)\n   - Abstract\n   - Categories\n   - Comments (e.g., \u201cX pages, Y figures, code: link\u201d)\n5. Confirm and submit.\n\nModeration typically takes 1\u20133 days. They check for:\n- Spam\n- Pseudoscience\n- Extremely unprofessional formatting\n\nIf your paper is structured like a normal ML paper, it should pass.\n\n---\n\n## 4. If you\u2019re worried about \u201cbig companies stealing it\u201d\n\nRealistically:\n\n- arXiv gives you a public timestamp.\n- Anyone who later publishes something similar *after* your arXiv posting date can be shown to have come later.\n- In research culture, prior arXiv appearance is widely recognized as establishing priority.\n\nIf you want *legal* protection (e.g., patents):\n\n- That\u2019s a separate process from arXiv.\n- Publishing on arXiv before filing a patent can, in some jurisdictions, count as public disclosure and affect patentability.\n- If patents matter to you, talk to a patent attorney *before* posting publicly.\n\nBut for academic / research \u201ccredit,\u201d arXiv + code is usually enough.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Given your current situation (gaming PC, great results)\n\nConcrete actions you can take this week:\n\n1. **Standardize experiments**:\n   - Pick 1\u20133 public benchmarks.\n   - Compare against strong, standard baselines.\n   - Log everything (seeds, hyperparameters).\n\n2. **Write the paper in LaTeX**:\n   - Use an ICLR/NeurIPS template.\n   - Aim for ~6\u201310 pages main text.\n\n3. **Open a GitHub repo**:\n   - Clean up your training script.\n   - Add instructions and example configs.\n\n4. **Ask for informal feedback** (optional but helpful):\n   - Post a draft in a relevant ML Discord/Slack/Reddit community.\n   - Or send to a friendly academic/engineer if you know any.\n\n5. **Submit to arXiv**:\n   - Create account.\n   - Upload.\n   - Get endorsement if needed.\n\nIf you want, you can paste a rough outline or abstract here, and I can help you shape it into something that looks like a real arXiv-ready paper.",
